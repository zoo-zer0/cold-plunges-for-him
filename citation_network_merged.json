Epub 2016 Aug 24.\n\nRecovery From Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage: Cold-Water Immersion Versus \nWhole-Body Cryotherapy.\n\nAbaïdia AE, Lamblin J, Delecroix B, Leduc C, McCall A, Nédélec M, Dawson B, \nBaquet G, Dupont G.\n\nPURPOSE: To compare the effects of cold-water immersion (CWI) and whole-body \ncryotherapy (WBC) on recovery kinetics after exercise-induced muscle damage.\nMETHODS: Ten physically active men performed single-leg hamstring eccentric \nexercise comprising 5 sets of 15 repetitions. Immediately postexercise, subjects \nwere exposed in a randomized crossover design to CWI (10 min at 10°C) or WBC (3 \nmin at -110°C) recovery. Creatine kinase concentrations, knee-flexor eccentric \n(60°/s) and posterior lower-limb isometric (60°) strength, single-leg and 2-leg \ncountermovement jumps, muscle soreness, and perception of recovery were \nmeasured. The tests were performed before and immediately, 24, 48, and 72 h \nafter exercise.\nRESULTS: Results showed a very likely moderate effect in favor of CWI for \nsingle-leg (effect size [ES] = 0.63; 90% confidence interval [CI] = -0.13 to \n1.38) and 2-leg countermovement jump (ES = 0.68; 90% CI = -0.08 to 1.43) 72 h \nafter exercise. Soreness was moderately lower 48 h after exercise after CWI (ES \n= -0.68; 90% CI = -1.44 to 0.07). Perception of recovery was moderately enhanced \n24 h after exercise for CWI (ES = -0.62; 90% CI = -1.38 to 0.13). Trivial and \nsmall effects of condition were found for the other outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI was more effective than WBC in accelerating recovery kinetics \nfor countermovement-jump performance at 72 h postexercise. CWI also demonstrated \nlower soreness and higher perceived recovery levels across 24-48 h postexercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1123/ijspp.2016-0186\nPMID: 27396361 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Epub 2010 Feb 25.\n\nMotor and sensory nerve conduction are affected differently by ice pack, ice \nmassage, and cold water immersion.\n\nHerrera E(1), Sandoval MC, Camargo DM, Salvini TF.\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos, Brazil.\n\nBACKGROUND: It is well known that reducing tissue temperature changes sensory \nand motor nerve conduction. However, few studies have compared the effect of \ndifferent cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice \nmassage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural \n(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.\nDESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were \nrandomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent \nvariables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. \nDependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.\nMETHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) \nyears, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold \nmodalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature \nand nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after \ncooling.\nRESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There \nalso was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the \ncompound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion \nreduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and \nmotor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the \nmost effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.\nLIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than \nthat of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment \ngroup. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.\nCONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and \nchanging sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to \ninduce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as \napplied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic \neffects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.\n\nDOI: 10.2522/ptj.20090131\nPMID: 20185615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After exercise, subjects immersed \none leg in a cold water bath (10°C, COLD) to the level of their gluteal fold for \n15 min. The contralateral leg remained outside the water bath and served as \ncontrol (CON). Core body temperature was monitored throughout the experiment, \nwhereas muscle biopsies and muscle temperature (Tm) measurements were obtained \nfrom the vastus lateralis before exercise (PRE), immediately postexercise \n(POST-EX, Tm only), immediately after cooling, and 3 h postexercise (POST-3H).\nRESULTS: Exercise significantly increased core body temperature (PRE, 37.1°C ± \n0.4°C vs POST-EX, 39.3°C ± 0.5°C, P < 0.001) and Tm in both CON (PRE, 33.9°C ± \n0.7°C vs POST-EX, 39.1°C ± 0.5°C) and COLD legs (PRE, 34.2°C ± 0.9°C vs POST-EX, \n39.4°C ± 0.3°C), respectively (P < 0.001). After cooling, Tm was significantly \nlower in COLD (28.9°C ± 2.3°C vs 37.0°C ± 0.8°C, P < 0.001) whereas PGC-1α \nmessenger RNA expression was significantly higher in COLD at POST-3H (P = \n0.014). Significant time effects were evident for changes in vascular \nendothelial growth factor (P = 0.038) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (P = \n0.019) expression. However, no significant condition effects between COLD and \nCON were evident for changes in both vascular endothelial growth factor and \nneuronal nitric oxide synthase expressions.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that an acute postexercise cooling intervention \nenhances the gene expression of PGC-1α and may therefore provide a valuable \nstrategy to enhance exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000308\nPMID: 24561815 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

VEGFtotal mRNA increased after CWI only (~2.4-fold) compared \nwith CONT (~1.1-fold) at 3 h post-exercise (P < 0.01). Study 2 Following CWI, \nPGC-1α mRNA expression was significantly increased ~1.3-fold (P = 0.001) and \n1.4-fold (P = 0.0004) at 3 and 6 h, respectively.

The aim of this \nstudy was to compare the effects of ecologically valid CWI and WBC protocols on \npostexercise lower limb thermoregulatory, femoral artery, and cutaneous blood \nflow responses.\nMETHODS: Ten males completed a continuous cycle exercise protocol at 70% maximal \noxygen uptake until a rectal temperature of 38°C was attained. Participants were \nthen exposed to lower-body CWI (8°C) for 10 min, or WBC (-110°C) for 2 min, in a \nrandomized crossover design. Rectal and thigh skin, deep, and superficial muscle \ntemperatures, thigh, and calf skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry), \nsuperficial femoral artery blood flow (duplex ultrasound), and arterial blood \npressure were measured before, and for 40 min post, cooling interventions.\nRESULTS: Greater reductions in thigh skin (CWI, -5.9°C ± 1.8°C; WBC, 0.2°C ± \n0.5°C; P < 0.001) and superficial (CWI, -4.4°C ± 1.3°C; WBC, -1.8°C ± 1.1°C; P < \n0.001) and deep (CWI, -2.9°C ± 0.8°C; WBC, -1.3°C ± 0.6°C; P < 0.001) muscle \ntemperatures occurred immediately after CWI. Decreases in femoral artery \nconductance were greater after CWI (CWI, -84% ± 11%; WBC, -59% ± 21%, P < 0.02) \nand thigh (CWI, -80% ± 5%; WBC, -59% ± 14%, P < 0.001), and calf (CWI, -73% ± \n13%; WBC, -45% ± 17%, P < 0.001) cutaneous vasoconstriction was greater after \nCWI. Reductions in rectal temperature were similar between conditions after \ncooling (CWI, -0.6°C ± 0.4°C; WBC, -0.6°C ± 0.3°C; P = 0.98).\nCONCLUSION: Greater reductions in blood flow and tissue temperature were \nobserved after CWI in comparison with WBC. These novel findings have practical \nand clinical implications for the use of cooling in the recovery from exercise \nand injury.\n\nDOI: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000001223\nPMID: 28141620 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the \nCWI group (P < 0.05). Isokinetic work (19%), type II muscle fibre \ncross-sectional area (17%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26%) increased \nin the ACT group (all P < 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine \nactive men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, \nfollowed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h \nafter exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion \nmolecule (NCAM) (10-30%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50%) increased 24-48 \nh after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h \nafter exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers \nwere greater after ACT than after CWI (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 \nkinase(Thr421/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was \ngreater after ACT (P < 0.05).

The \naim was to compare the effects of ice pack and cold-water immersion on the \nmuscular performance parameters of plantar flexors and muscular activation of \nthe triceps surae. 41 healthy men (mean age: 22.1 years, SD: 2.9) were randomly \nassigned to cooling with either ice pack (n=20) or cold-water immersion (n=21). \nIndependent variables were cold modality (ice pack or cold-water immersion) and \npre- and post-cooling measurement time. Dependent variables were muscular \nperformance (measured during isometric and concentric contractions of plantar \nflexors) and electromyography parameters of the triceps surae (median frequency \nand root mean square amplitude). Dependent-samples t-tests were used to compare \npre- and post-cooling data and independent-samples t-tests were used to compare \nthe difference (pre- and post-cooling) between groups. Ice pack increased \nisometric peak torque (mean: 9.00 Nm, P=0.01) and both cold modalities reduced \nmuscular activation in triceps surae (P<0.0001); Cold-water immersion and ice \npack reduced peak torque and total work during dynamic isokinetic contraction at \nboth velocities (mean: -11,00 Nm, P<0.05) and affected muscular activation in \ndifferent ways.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of whole \nbody cryotherapy (WBC) and cold water immersion (CWI) on markers of recovery \nfollowing a marathon.\nMETHODS: Thirty-one endurance trained males completed a marathon. Participants \nwere randomly assigned to a CWI, WBC or placebo group.

Blood samples were taken at \nbaseline, post intervention and 24 and 48 h post intervention to assess \ninflammation and muscle damage.\nRESULTS: WBC had a harmful effect on muscle function compared to CWI post \nmarathon. WBC positively influenced perceptions of training stress compared to \nCWI. With the exception of C-reactive protein (CRP) at 24 and 48 h, neither \ncryotherapy intervention positively influenced blood borne markers of \ninflammation or structural damage compared to placebo.\nCONCLUSION: The findings show WBC has a negative impact on muscle function, \nperceptions of soreness and a number of blood parameters compared to CWI, \ncontradicting the suggestion that WBC may be a superior recovery strategy. \nFurther, cryotherapy is no more effective than a placebo intervention at \nimproving functional recovery or perceptions of training stress following a \nmarathon.

Twenty-male soccer players completed one match and \nwere randomly divided into cryotherapy (10 min cold water immersion, 10°C, n = \n10) and thermoneutral (10 min thermoneutral water immersion, 35°C, n = 10) \ngroups. Muscle damage (creatine kinase, myoglobin), inflammation (C-reactive \nprotein), neuromuscular function (jump and sprint abilities and maximal \nisometric quadriceps strength), and delayed-onset muscle soreness were evaluated \nbefore, within 30 min of the end, and 24 and 48 h after the match. After the \nmatch, the players in both groups showed increased plasma creatine kinase \nactivity (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 min) and C-reactive protein (30 \nmin, 24 h) concentrations. Peak jump ability and maximal strength were decreased \nand delayed-onset muscle soreness increased in both groups. However, \ndifferential alterations were observed between thermoneutral water and cold \nwater immersion groups in creatine kinase (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 \nmin), C-reactive protein (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), quadriceps strength (24 h), and \nquadriceps (24 h), calf (24 h) and adductor (30 min) delayed-onset muscle \nsoreness. The results suggest that cold water immersion immediately after a \none-off soccer match reduces muscle damage and discomfort, possibly contributing \nto a faster recovery of neuromuscular function.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/02640414.2010.526132\nPMID: 21170794 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This study \nexamined the physiological merit of CWI for recovery from high-intensity \nexercise by investigating if the placebo effect is responsible for any acute \nperformance or psychological benefits.\nMETHODS: Thirty males (mean ± SD: age, 24 ± 5 yr; VO2 peak, 51.1 ± 7.0 mL · \nkg(-1) · min(-1)) performed an acute high-intensity interval training session, \ncomprised of 4 × 30-s sprints, immediately followed by one of the following \nthree 15-min recovery conditions: CWI (10.3°C ± 0.2°C), thermoneutral water \nimmersion placebo (TWP) (34.7°C ± 0.1°C), or thermoneutral water immersion \ncontrol (TWI) (34.7°C ± 0.1°C). An intramuscular thermistor was inserted during \nexercise and recovery to record muscle temperature. Swelling (thigh girth), pain \nthreshold/tolerance, interleukin 6 concentration, and total leukocyte, \nneutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were recorded at baseline, postexercise, \npostrecovery, and 1, 24, and 48 h postexercise. A maximal voluntary isometric \ncontraction (MVC) of the quadriceps was performed at the same time points, with \nthe exception of postexercise. Self-assessments of readiness for exercise, \nfatigue, vigor, sleepiness, pain, and belief of recovery effectiveness were also \ncompleted.\nRESULTS: Leg strength after the MVC and ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, \nand vigor were significantly impaired in TWI compared with those in CWI and TWP \nwhich were similar to each other.\nCONCLUSIONS: A recovery placebo administered after an acute high-intensity \ninterval training session is superior in the recovery of muscle strength over 48 \nh as compared with TWI and is as effective as CWI. This can be attributed to \nimproved ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, and vigor, suggesting that the \ncommonly hypothesized physiological benefits surrounding CWI are at least partly \nplacebo related.\n\nDOI: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000348\nPMID: 24674975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After performing a bout of damage-inducing eccentric exercise (eight \nsets of five maximal reciprocal contractions at 0.58 rad x s(-1)) of the elbow \nflexors on an isokinetic dynamometer, 15 females aged 22.0+/-2.0 years (mean +/- \ns) were allocated to a control group (no treatment, n = 7) or a cryotherapy \ngroup (n = 8). Subjects in the cryotherapy group immersed their exercised arm in \ncold water (15 degrees C) for 15 min immediately after eccentric exercise and \nthen every 12 h for 15 min for a total of seven sessions. Muscle tenderness, \nplasma creatine kinase activity, relaxed elbow angle, isometric strength and \nswelling (upper arm circumference) were measured immediately before and for 3 \ndays after eccentric exercise. Analysis of variance revealed significant (P < \n0.05) main effects for time for all variables, with increases in muscle \ntenderness, creatine kinase activity and upper arm circumference, and decreases \nin isometric strength and relaxed elbow angle. There were significant \ninteractions (P<0.05) of group x time for relaxed elbow angle and creatine \nkinase activity. Relaxed elbow angle was greater and creatine kinase activity \nlower for the cryotherapy group than the controls on days 2 and 3 following the \neccentric exercise. We conclude that although cold water immersion may reduce \nmuscle stiffness and the amount of post-exercise damage after strenuous \neccentric activity, there appears to be no effect on the perception of \ntenderness and strength loss, which is characteristic after this form of \nactivity.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/026404199366136\nPMID: 10362390 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Treatments were reversed in the second \nsession (after 1 week).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine \naminotransferase enzymes; perceived muscle soreness; and recovery through visual \nanalogue scales and muscle power of the upper and lower limbs at pretraining, \npostrecovery, 24 hours, and 48 hours.\nRESULTS: Athletes who underwent CWI showed better posttraining recovery measures \nbecause circulating LDH levels were lower at 24 hours postrecovery in the CWI \ncondition (441.9 ± 81.4 IU/L) than in the control condition (493.6 ± 97.4 IU/L; \nP = .03). Estimated muscle power was higher in the CWI than in the control \ncondition for both upper limbs (757.9 ± 125.1 W versus 695.9 ± 56.1 W) and lower \nlimbs (53.7 ± 3.7 cm versus 35.5 ± 8.2 cm; both P values = .001). In addition, \nwe observed less perceived muscle soreness (1.5 ± 1.1 arbitrary units [au] \nversus 3.1 ± 1.0 au; P = .004) and higher perceived recovery (8.8 ± 1.9 au \nversus 6.9 ± 1.7 au; P = .005) in the CWI than in the control condition at 24 \nhours postrecovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of CWI can be beneficial to jiu-jitsu athletes because it \nreduces circulating LDH levels, results in less perceived muscle soreness, and \nhelps muscle power recovery at 24 hours postrecovery.\n\nDOI: 10.4085/1062-6050-51.9.01\nPMCID: PMC5317190\nPMID: 27575565 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Repeated sprint ability, strength, muscle soreness and inflammatory \nmarkers were measured across the 48-h post-exercise period. Eleven male \nteam-sport athletes completed three 3-day testing trials, each separated by 2 \nweeks. On day 1, baseline measures of performance (10 m x 20 m sprints and \nisometric strength of quadriceps, hamstrings and hip flexors) were recorded. \nParticipants then performed 80 min of simulated team sports exercise followed by \na 20-m shuttle run test to exhaustion. Upon completion of the exercise, and 24h \nlater, participants performed one of the post-exercise recovery procedures for \n15 min. At 48 h post-exercise, the performance tests were repeated. Blood \nsamples and muscle soreness ratings were taken before and immediately after \npost-exercise, and at 24h and 48 h post-exercise. In comparison to the control \nand CWI treatments, COLD resulted in significantly lower (p<0.05) muscle \nsoreness ratings, as well as in reduced decrements to isometric leg extension \nand flexion strength in the 48-h post-exercise period. COLD also facilitated a \nmore rapid return to baseline repeated sprint performances. The only benefit of \nCWI over control was a significant reduction in muscle soreness 24h \npost-exercise. This study demonstrated that COLD following exhaustive simulated \nteam sports exercise offers greater recovery benefits than CWI or control \ntreatments.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.jsams.2007.12.011\nPMID: 18547863 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The ISE consisted of a 15-m \nsprint every minute separated by self-paced bouts of hard running, jogging, and \nwalking for the remainder of the minute. Every sixth rotation, participants \nperformed 5 × 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on \neach effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with \nvoluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function \n(voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of \nperceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for \nmetabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, \nimmediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery.\nRESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in \nCONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P > 0.05). TCWI \nresulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P < 0.05). \nM-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and \n2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P < 0.05). Although TCWI had no \neffect on the elevation in blood markers for muscle damage (P > 0.05), lactate \nwas significantly reduced after recovery compared with TPASS (P = 0.04). CWI \nalso resulted in reduced MS 2 h after recovery compared with TPASS (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The introduction of body contact reduces exercise performance, \nwhereas the use of CWI results in a faster recovery of MVC, VA, and RMS and \nimproves muscle contractile properties and perceptions of soreness after \ncollision-based exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31822b0977\nPMID: 21716151 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Using a randomized, cross-over design, 10 physically active men \nperformed high-intensity resistance exercise followed by one of two recovery \ninterventions: 1) 10 min of CWI at 10°C or 2) 10 min of active recovery \n(low-intensity cycling). After the recovery interventions, maximal muscle \nfunction was assessed after 2 and 4 h by measuring jump height and isometric \nsquat strength. Submaximal muscle function was assessed after 6 h by measuring \nthe average load lifted during 6 sets of 10 squats at 80% of 1 repetition \nmaximum. Intramuscular temperature (1 cm) was also recorded, and venous blood \nsamples were analyzed for markers of metabolism, vasoconstriction, and muscle \ndamage. CWI did not enhance recovery of maximal muscle function. However, during \nthe final three sets of the submaximal muscle function test, participants lifted \na greater load (P < 0.05, Cohen's effect size: 1.3, 38%) after CWI compared with \nactive recovery. During CWI, muscle temperature decreased ∼7°C below \npostexercise values and remained below preexercise values for another 35 min. \nVenous blood O2 saturation decreased below preexercise values for 1.5 h after \nCWI. Serum endothelin-1 concentration did not change after CWI, whereas it \ndecreased after active recovery. Plasma myoglobin concentration was lower, \nwhereas plasma IL-6 concentration was higher after CWI compared with active \nrecovery.

Twenty-two \nhealthy Division I collegiate soccer players (13 men and 9 women; age, 19.8 ± \n1.1 years; height, 174.0 ± 9.0 cm; mass, 72.1 ± 9.1 kg) volunteered as \nparticipants during the noncompetitive season. The YIRT was used to induce \nvolitional fatigue and was administered at baseline and again 48 hours later. \nAthletes progressively increased sprint speed between markers set 20 m apart \nuntil pace was failed. Countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) was used to assess \nanaerobic power and was measured before YIRT, immediately post-YIRT, and 24 and \n48 hours post-YIRT. A 10-cm horizontal visual analog scale was administered \nimmediately, 24 hours and 48 hours post-YIRT to assess perceived fatigue (PF) in \nthe legs. Participants were randomly placed into the CWI or control group. The \nCWI condition consisted of immersion to the umbilicus in a 12°C pool for 15 \nminutes, whereas the control group sat quietly for 15 minutes. There were no \nsignificant differences between intervention conditions on YIRT performance \n(control, 4,900 ± 884 m; CWI, 5,288 ± 1,000 m; p = 0.35) or PF (control, 9.4 ± \n0.5 cm; CWI, 9.3 ± 0.6 cm; p = 0.65) at 48 hours post-YIRT. There was a main \ntime effect for CMVJ over 48 hours, but no group differences (pre-YIRT, 64.6 ± \n11.0 cm; post-YIRT, 66.4 ± 10.9 cm; 24 hours post-YIRT, 63.4 ± 9.9 cm; 48 hours \npost-YIRT, 63.1 ± 9.4 cm; p = 0.02).

Ten subjects completed \ntwo testing sessions separated by 1 week; each trial consisted of an initial \nall-out 35-min exercise bout, one of two 15-min recovery interventions \n(randomised: CWI or ACT), followed by a 40-min passive recovery period before \nrepeating the 35-min exercise bout. Performance was measured as the change in \ntotal work completed during the exercise bouts. Resting limb blood flow, heart \nrate, rectal temperature and blood lactate were recorded throughout the testing \nsessions. There was a significant decline in performance after ACT (mean (SD) \n-1.81% (1.05%)) compared with CWI where performance remained unchanged (0.10% \n(0.71%)).

Circulating \nmediators of the inflammatory response were measured from EDTA plasma taken \npre-exercise (baseline), immediately post-exercise, and at 2, 24, and 48 h \npost-exercise. Ratings of perceived soreness and impairment were noted on a \n10-pt Likert scale, and squat jump and drop jump were performed at these time \npoints.\nRESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, and MPO increased significantly from baseline immediately \npost-exercise in all conditions. IL-6 remained elevated from baseline at 2 h in \nthe CWI-30 min × 20 °C, CWI-10 min × 10 °C, and CWI-30 min × 10 °C conditions, \nwhile further increases were observed for IL-8 and MPO in the CWI-30 min × 20 °C \nand CWI-30 min × 10 °C conditions. Squat jump and drop jump height were \nsignificantly lower in all conditions immediately post-exercise and at 2 h. Drop \njump remained below baseline at 24 and 48 h in the CON and CWI-10 min × 20 °C \nconditions only, while squat jump height returned to baseline in all conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cold-water immersion appears to facilitate restoration of muscle \nperformance in a stretch-shortening cycle, but not concentric power. These \nchanges do not appear to be related to inflammatory modulation. CWI protocols of \nexcessive duration may actually exacerbate the concentration of cytokines in \ncirculation post-exercise; however, the origin of the circulating cytokines is \nnot necessarily skeletal muscle.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s00421-014-2954-2\nPMID: 25074283 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Countermovement jump height, muscle soreness and perceived \nrecovery and stress were measured 24h before the half-marathon (pre), \nimmediately after the recovery intervention (postrec) and 24h after the race \n(post24). In addition, muscle contractile properties and blood markers of \nfatigue were determined at pre and post24.\nRESULTS: Magnitude-based inferences revealed substantial differences in the \nchanges between the groups. At postrec, ACT was harmful to perceived recovery \n(ACT vs. PAS: effect size [ES] = -1.81) and serum concentration of creatine \nkinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.42), with CWI being harmful to jump performance (CWI \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.98). It was also beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.88) and improving perceived stress (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.64), \nwith MAS being beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (MAS vs. PAS: ES = -0.52) \nand improving perceived recovery (MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.00). At post24, both CWI \nand MAS were still beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = \n1.49; MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.12), with ACT being harmful to perceived recovery (ACT \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.68), serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = \n0.84) and free-testosterone (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.91).\nCONCLUSIONS: In recreational runners, a half-marathon results in fatigue \nsymptoms lasting at least 24h. To restore subjective fatigue measures, the \nauthors recommend CWI and MAS, as these recovery strategies are more effective \nthan PAS, with ACT being even disadvantageous. However, runners must be aware \nthat neither the use of ACT nor CWI or MAS had any beneficial effect on \nobjective fatigue markers.\n\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0207313\nPMCID: PMC6226207\nPMID: 30412626 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have declared that no competing \ninterests exist.",

Twenty males (mean age 22.3 years, s = 3.3; height 1.80 \nm, s = 0.05; body mass 83.7 kg, s = 11.9) completed a 90-min intermittent \nshuttle run previously shown to result in marked muscle damage and soreness. \nAfter exercise, participants were randomly assigned to either 10 min cold-water \nimmersion (mean 10 degrees C, s = 0.5) or a non-immersion control group. Ratings \nof perceived soreness, changes in muscular function and efflux of intracellular \nproteins were monitored before exercise, during treatment, and at regular \nintervals up to 7 days post-exercise. Exercise resulted in severe muscle \nsoreness, temporary muscular dysfunction, and elevated serum markers of muscle \ndamage, all peaking within 48 h after exercise. Cryotherapy administered \nimmediately after exercise reduced muscle soreness at 1, 24, and 48 h (P < \n0.05). Decrements in isometric maximal voluntary contraction of the knee flexors \nwere reduced after cryotherapy treatment at 24 (mean 12%, s(x) = 4) and 48 h \n(mean 3%, s(x) = 3) compared with the control group (mean 21%, s(x) = 5 and mean \n14%, s(x) = 5 respectively; P < 0.05).

CWI had no effect on these markers. Numbers of the most \nabundant circulating cell type, neutrophils, were elevated at POST more so in \nCWI (p < 0.05, vs. CON).

We tested \nathletes before and after each intervention week regarding swim (100 m freestyle \nsprints) and functional performance (flexibility, upper and lower body power, \nand shoulder proprioception). We monitored athlete's perceptions (well-being, \nheaviness, tiredness, discomfort and pain) during testing sessions using a \n5-item questionnaire. Athlete preferences regarding the interventions were \nassessed at the end of the study. We used generalized linear mixed models and \ngeneralized estimating equations for continuous and categorical variables, \nrespectively (intervention x time).\nRESULTS: We found a time effect for swim performance (p = .01) in which, \nregardless the intervention, all athletes improved sprint time at \npost-intervention compared to baseline. There was an intervention effect for \npain (p = .04) and tiredness (p = .04), but with no significant post-hoc \ncomparisons. We found no significant effects for other outcomes. All athletes \nreported a preference for CWI or TWI in relation to PAS.\nCONCLUSION: The repeated use of CWI throughout a training week did not impact \nfunctional or swim performance outcomes of competitive adolescent swimmers. \nPerceptive outcomes were also similar across interventions; however, athletes \nindicated a preference for both CWI and TWI.\n\n© 2024.

In a randomized design, eight soccer players completed the Loughborough \nIntermittent Shuttle Test followed by 10 min of either CWI (10C°) or \nthermoneutral water immersion (TWI) (28C°). Physical performance (Squat jump: \nSJ, countermovement jump: CMJ, maximal voluntary contraction: MVC, and 20 m \nsprint: SP), muscle damage parameter (creatine kinase: CK) and perceived muscle \nsoreness were assessed at baseline, 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after the \nintermittent test. After the test, a decrease was observed in SJ and in CMJ at \n0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h with TWI (p < 0.05) and only at 0 h for SJ with CWI \n(p < 0.05). SP decreased at 24 h and 48 h after the test with TWI (p < 0.05) and \nonly at 24 h with CWI (p < 0.05). MVC, CK activity and perceived muscle soreness \nincreased in both condition after the test and returned to baseline levels 72 h \nafter the test with TWI (p < 0.05) and at 48 h with CWI (p < 0.05). For the \ncorrelation between physical performance and muscle damage parameters in CWI \nsession, the statistical analysis didn't reveal any significant link between CK \nand SJ, CMJ, MVC or SP values (p > 0.05). The results suggest that CWI \nimmediately after an intermittent test reduces muscle damage and perceived \nmuscle soreness, and accelerate recovery of physical performance in professional \nsoccer players. However, the faster recovery of physical performance seems not \nbe related to the lower level of muscle damage induced by CWI.\n\nCopyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Electronic address: marius.brazaitis@lsu.lt.\n\nA poor outcome of whole-body hypothermia often results from a late complication, \nrather than from acute effects of hypothermia. A low body (cell) temperature or \nthe increase in the concentrations of the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, \nand norepinephrine in response to acute cold stress have been proposed as potent \nproinflammatory cytokine suppressant. In the current study, we tested the \nhypothesis that the recovery of body temperature from a whole-body intermittent \ncold-water immersion (CWI, at 13-14 °C for a total 170 min) is associated with a \ndelayed response of proinflammatory cytokines in young healthy men. Our results \nrevealed a delay in the increase in the proinflammatory interleukin 6 and \ninterleukin 1β cytokines after the CWI, which paralleled the changes in \ncortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and body temperature. CWI decreased tumor \nnecrosis factor α (TNF-α) immediately and 1 h after the CWI. Although TNF-α had \nrecovered to the pre-immersion level at 2 h after CWI, its natural circadian \ncycle kinetics was disrupted until 12 h after the CWI. Furthermore, we showed \nthat CWI strongly modified the white blood cell counts, with changes reaching a \npeak between 1 and 2 h after the CWI.\n\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

After \nweek 1 training, all players completed a passive recovery (PAS). During week 2, \nCOLD or CWT was randomly assigned. Players undertook the opposing intervention \nin week 3. Repeat-sprint ability (6 × 20 m), countermovement and squat jumps, \nperceived muscle soreness, and fatigue were measured pretraining and over 48 h \nposttraining.\nRESULTS: Immediately posttraining, groups exhibited similar performance and \npsychometric declines. At 24 h, repeat-sprint time had deteriorated by 4.1% for \nPAS and 1.0% for CWT but was fully restored by COLD (0.0%). At 24 and 48 h, both \nCOLD and CWT attenuated changes in mean muscle soreness, with COLD (0.6 ± 0.6 \nand 0.0 ± 0.4) more effective than CWT (1.9 ± 0.7 and 1.0 ± 0.7) and PAS having \nminimal effect (5.5 ± 0.6 and 4.0 ± 0.5). Similarly, after 24 and 48 h, COLD and \nCWT both effectively reduced changes in perceived fatigue, with COLD (0.6 ± 0.6 \nand 0.0 ± 0.6) being more successful than CWT (0.8 ± 0.6 and 0.7 ± 0.6) and PAS \nhaving the smallest effect (2.2 ± 0.8 and 2.4 ± 0.6).\nCONCLUSIONS: AF training can result in prolonged physical and psychometric \ndeficits persisting for up to 48 h. For restoring physical-performance and \npsychometric measures, COLD was more effective than CWT, with PAS being the \nleast effective.

Treatments were reversed in the second \nsession (after 1 week).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine \naminotransferase enzymes; perceived muscle soreness; and recovery through visual \nanalogue scales and muscle power of the upper and lower limbs at pretraining, \npostrecovery, 24 hours, and 48 hours.\nRESULTS: Athletes who underwent CWI showed better posttraining recovery measures \nbecause circulating LDH levels were lower at 24 hours postrecovery in the CWI \ncondition (441.9 ± 81.4 IU/L) than in the control condition (493.6 ± 97.4 IU/L; \nP = .03). Estimated muscle power was higher in the CWI than in the control \ncondition for both upper limbs (757.9 ± 125.1 W versus 695.9 ± 56.1 W) and lower \nlimbs (53.7 ± 3.7 cm versus 35.5 ± 8.2 cm; both P values = .001). In addition, \nwe observed less perceived muscle soreness (1.5 ± 1.1 arbitrary units [au] \nversus 3.1 ± 1.0 au; P = .004) and higher perceived recovery (8.8 ± 1.9 au \nversus 6.9 ± 1.7 au; P = .005) in the CWI than in the control condition at 24 \nhours postrecovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of CWI can be beneficial to jiu-jitsu athletes because it \nreduces circulating LDH levels, results in less perceived muscle soreness, and \nhelps muscle power recovery at 24 hours postrecovery.\n\nDOI: 10.4085/1062-6050-51.9.01\nPMCID: PMC5317190\nPMID: 27575565 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, few studies have compared the effect of \ndifferent cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice \nmassage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural \n(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.\nDESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were \nrandomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent \nvariables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. \nDependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.\nMETHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) \nyears, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold \nmodalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature \nand nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after \ncooling.\nRESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There \nalso was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the \ncompound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion \nreduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and \nmotor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the \nmost effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.\nLIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than \nthat of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment \ngroup. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.\nCONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and \nchanging sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to \ninduce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as \napplied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic \neffects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.\n\nDOI: 10.2522/ptj.20090131\nPMID: 20185615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-eight females were allocated to PBC \n(30 seconds at -60°C, 2 minutes at -135°C), CWI (10 minutes at 10°C), or CON \n(10 minutes resting). Muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2 ), cutaneous vascular \nconductance (CVC), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and local skin temperature were \nassessed at baseline and through 60 minutes (10-minute intervals), while delayed \nonset of muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle swelling, maximum voluntary isometric \ncontraction (MVIC), and vertical jump performance (VJP) were assessed up to \n72 hours (24-hour intervals) following treatments. SmO2 was lower in PBC \n(Δ-2.77 ± 13.08%) and CWI (Δ-5.91 ± 11.80%) compared with CON (Δ18.96 ± 1.46%) \nthroughout the 60-minute follow-up period (P < .001).

Repeated sprint ability, strength, muscle soreness and inflammatory \nmarkers were measured across the 48-h post-exercise period. Eleven male \nteam-sport athletes completed three 3-day testing trials, each separated by 2 \nweeks. On day 1, baseline measures of performance (10 m x 20 m sprints and \nisometric strength of quadriceps, hamstrings and hip flexors) were recorded. \nParticipants then performed 80 min of simulated team sports exercise followed by \na 20-m shuttle run test to exhaustion. Upon completion of the exercise, and 24h \nlater, participants performed one of the post-exercise recovery procedures for \n15 min. At 48 h post-exercise, the performance tests were repeated. Blood \nsamples and muscle soreness ratings were taken before and immediately after \npost-exercise, and at 24h and 48 h post-exercise. In comparison to the control \nand CWI treatments, COLD resulted in significantly lower (p<0.05) muscle \nsoreness ratings, as well as in reduced decrements to isometric leg extension \nand flexion strength in the 48-h post-exercise period. COLD also facilitated a \nmore rapid return to baseline repeated sprint performances. The only benefit of \nCWI over control was a significant reduction in muscle soreness 24h \npost-exercise.

In the present study we compared the \nshort-term effects of cold water immersion therapy (CWIT) and light emitting \ndiode therapy (LEDT) with placebo LEDT on biochemical markers related to \nskeletal muscle recovery after high-intensity exercise. A randomized \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed with six male \nyoung futsal athletes. They were treated with CWIT (5°C of temperature [SD \n±1°]), active LEDT (69 LEDs with wavelengths 660/850 nm, 10/30 mW of output \npower, 30 s of irradiation time per point, and 41.7 J of total energy irradiated \nper point, total of ten points irradiated) or an identical placebo LEDT 5 min \nafter each of three Wingate cycle tests. Pre-exercise, post-exercise, and \npost-treatment measurements were taken of blood lactate levels, creatine kinase \n(CK) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. There were no significant \ndifferences in the work performed during the three Wingate tests (p > 0.05). All \nbiochemical parameters increased from baseline values (p < 0.05) after the three \nexercise tests, but only active LEDT decreased blood lactate levels (p = 0.0065) \nand CK activity (p = 0.0044) significantly after treatment. There were no \nsignificant differences in CRP values after treatments. We concluded that \ntreating the leg muscles with LEDT 5 min after the Wingate cycle test seemed to \ninhibit the expected post-exercise increase in blood lactate levels and CK \nactivity. This suggests that LEDT has better potential than 5 min of CWIT for \nimproving short-term post-exercise recovery.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s10103-010-0866-x\nPMCID: PMC3119799\nPMID: 21088862 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflicts \nof interest.",

The aims of this study were to compare the effects of \ntwo strategies of CWI, using different water temperatures with passive recovery \npost exercise in the management of some markers of muscle damage, and to observe \nwhether any of the techniques used caused deleterious effects on performance. \nSixty healthy male participants performed an eccentric protocol to induce muscle \ndamage and were then randomized to one of three groups (CWI1: 15 min at 9 °C; \nCWI2: 15 min at 14 °C; CG: control group). Levels of creatine kinase, muscle \nsoreness, pain threshold, perception of recovery, and maximal voluntary \nisometric contraction were monitored up to 96 h post exercise. A large effect \nfor time for all outcomes was observed [P < 0.001; CK (ES = 0.516), muscle \nsoreness (ES = 0.368); pain threshold (ES = 0.184); perception of recovery \n(ES = 0.565); MVIC (ES = 0.273)]. CWI groups presented an earlier recovery for \nmuscle soreness with lower ratings immediately post recovery. For delayed \neffects, the application of CWI2 (15 min at 14 °C) presented earlier recovery \ncompared with CWI1 and control condition for maximal voluntary isometric \ncontraction (P < 0.05). There were no significant group and interaction (Group × \nTime) effects. CWI groups acted more efficiently for muscle soreness and \nperformance considering the time of recovery was observed.

Twenty-three under-20 semi-professionals male soccer players \nwere randomly allocated into cold water immersion group (bathtub with water and \nice at 10 °C ± 1 °C for 10 min) or control group (rest for 10 min), every day, \nafter training sessions during a preseason. Primary outcome was change in \ncreatine kinase (CK) concentration, and secondary outcomes were changes in \nvertical jump performance, strength and perception of recovery at baseline (T0) \nand after protocol training (T1).\nRESULTS: Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) showed a statistically significant \ntime-group interactions for CK concentration, with an average reduction of \n280.39 U/L (CI95% = -519.14, -41.64; d = 0.55) in the cold-water immersion \ncompared to the control group. No differences between groups were observed in \nany other measures.\nCONCLUSION: Multiple cold-water immersions at 10 °C for 10 min decreases CK \nconcentration but does not change any clinical and neuromuscular markers of \nmuscle damage in soccer players during a 9-day preseason.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The ISE consisted of a 15-m \nsprint every minute separated by self-paced bouts of hard running, jogging, and \nwalking for the remainder of the minute. Every sixth rotation, participants \nperformed 5 × 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on \neach effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with \nvoluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function \n(voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of \nperceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for \nmetabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, \nimmediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery.\nRESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in \nCONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P > 0.05). TCWI \nresulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P < 0.05). \nM-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and \n2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P < 0.05). Although TCWI had no \neffect on the elevation in blood markers for muscle damage (P > 0.05), lactate \nwas significantly reduced after recovery compared with TPASS (P = 0.04). CWI \nalso resulted in reduced MS 2 h after recovery compared with TPASS (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The introduction of body contact reduces exercise performance, \nwhereas the use of CWI results in a faster recovery of MVC, VA, and RMS and \nimproves muscle contractile properties and perceptions of soreness after \ncollision-based exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31822b0977\nPMID: 21716151 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The recovery intervention consisted of different water \nimmersion techniques, including: temperate water immersion (36°C; TWI), cold \nwater immersion (10°C; CWI), contrast water temperature (10-42°C; CWT) and a \npassive recovery (PAS). Performances during a maximal 30-s rowing test (P(30 \ns)), a maximal vertical counter-movement jump (CMJ) and a maximal isometric \nvoluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensor muscles were measured at rest \n(Pre-exercise), immediately after the exercise (Post-exercise), 1 h after (Post \n1 h) and 24 h later (Post 24 h). Leukocyte profile and venous blood markers of \nmuscle damage (creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were also \nmeasured Pre-exercise, Post 1 h and Post 24 h. A significant time effect was \nobserved to indicate a reduction in performance (Pre-exercise vs. Post-exercise) \nfollowing the exercise bout in all conditions (P < 0.05). Indeed, at 1 h post \nexercise, a significant improvement in MVC and P(30 s) was respectively observed \nin the CWI and CWT groups compared to pre-exercise. Further, for the CWI group, \nthis result was associated with a comparative blunting of the rise in total \nnumber of leucocytes at 1 h post and of plasma concentration of CK at 24 h post. \nThe results indicate that the practice of cold water immersion and contrast \nwater therapy are more effective immersion modalities to promote a faster acute \nrecovery of maximal anaerobic performances (MVC and 30″ all-out respectively) \nafter an intermittent exhaustive exercise. These results may be explained by the \nsuppression of plasma concentrations of markers of inflammation and damage, \nsuggesting reduced passive leakage from disrupted skeletal muscle, which may \nresult in the increase in force production during ensuing bouts of exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s00421-010-1754-6\nPMID: 21132438 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Intramuscular temperature (1 cm) was also recorded, and venous blood \nsamples were analyzed for markers of metabolism, vasoconstriction, and muscle \ndamage. CWI did not enhance recovery of maximal muscle function. However, during \nthe final three sets of the submaximal muscle function test, participants lifted \na greater load (P < 0.05, Cohen's effect size: 1.3, 38%) after CWI compared with \nactive recovery. During CWI, muscle temperature decreased ∼7°C below \npostexercise values and remained below preexercise values for another 35 min. \nVenous blood O2 saturation decreased below preexercise values for 1.5 h after \nCWI.

Twenty-two \nhealthy Division I collegiate soccer players (13 men and 9 women; age, 19.8 ± \n1.1 years; height, 174.0 ± 9.0 cm; mass, 72.1 ± 9.1 kg) volunteered as \nparticipants during the noncompetitive season. The YIRT was used to induce \nvolitional fatigue and was administered at baseline and again 48 hours later. \nAthletes progressively increased sprint speed between markers set 20 m apart \nuntil pace was failed. Countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) was used to assess \nanaerobic power and was measured before YIRT, immediately post-YIRT, and 24 and \n48 hours post-YIRT. A 10-cm horizontal visual analog scale was administered \nimmediately, 24 hours and 48 hours post-YIRT to assess perceived fatigue (PF) in \nthe legs. Participants were randomly placed into the CWI or control group. The \nCWI condition consisted of immersion to the umbilicus in a 12°C pool for 15 \nminutes, whereas the control group sat quietly for 15 minutes. There were no \nsignificant differences between intervention conditions on YIRT performance \n(control, 4,900 ± 884 m; CWI, 5,288 ± 1,000 m; p = 0.35) or PF (control, 9.4 ± \n0.5 cm; CWI, 9.3 ± 0.6 cm; p = 0.65) at 48 hours post-YIRT.

No significant time × group interaction was obtained \nfor muscle strength, vertical jump height recovery and MMP-2 \nactivity (p > 0.05). At 24 h, muscle thickness from the CWI group returned to \nbaseline and was lower than the control (p = 0.04). DOMS returned to baseline at \n168 h for the CWI group (p = 0.109) but not for the control (p = 0.008).

Strength trained males (n = 38) completed two \nexperimental trials separated by 8 months in a randomised crossover design; one \ntrial involved passive recovery (PAS, control), the other a specific \nhydrotherapy protocol for 72 h post-exercise; either: (1) cold water immersion \n(CWI: n = 12), (2) hot water immersion (HWI: n = 11) or (3) contrast water \ntherapy (CWT: n = 15). For each trial, subjects performed a DOMS-inducing leg \npress protocol followed by PAS or one of the hydrotherapy interventions for 14 \nmin. Weighted squat jump, isometric squat, perceived pain, thigh girths and \nblood variables were measured prior to, immediately after, and at 24, 48 and 72 \nh post-exercise. Squat jump performance and isometric force recovery were \nsignificantly enhanced (P < 0.05) at 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise following CWT \nand at 48 and 72 h post-exercise following CWI when compared to PAS. Isometric \nforce recovery was also greater (P < 0.05) at 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise \nfollowing HWI when compared to PAS.

Circulating \nmediators of the inflammatory response were measured from EDTA plasma taken \npre-exercise (baseline), immediately post-exercise, and at 2, 24, and 48 h \npost-exercise. Ratings of perceived soreness and impairment were noted on a \n10-pt Likert scale, and squat jump and drop jump were performed at these time \npoints.\nRESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, and MPO increased significantly from baseline immediately \npost-exercise in all conditions. IL-6 remained elevated from baseline at 2 h in \nthe CWI-30 min × 20 °C, CWI-10 min × 10 °C, and CWI-30 min × 10 °C conditions, \nwhile further increases were observed for IL-8 and MPO in the CWI-30 min × 20 °C \nand CWI-30 min × 10 °C conditions. Squat jump and drop jump height were \nsignificantly lower in all conditions immediately post-exercise and at 2 h.

Countermovement jump height, muscle soreness and perceived \nrecovery and stress were measured 24h before the half-marathon (pre), \nimmediately after the recovery intervention (postrec) and 24h after the race \n(post24). In addition, muscle contractile properties and blood markers of \nfatigue were determined at pre and post24.\nRESULTS: Magnitude-based inferences revealed substantial differences in the \nchanges between the groups. At postrec, ACT was harmful to perceived recovery \n(ACT vs. PAS: effect size [ES] = -1.81) and serum concentration of creatine \nkinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.42), with CWI being harmful to jump performance (CWI \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.98). It was also beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.88) and improving perceived stress (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.64), \nwith MAS being beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (MAS vs. PAS: ES = -0.52) \nand improving perceived recovery (MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.00). At post24, both CWI \nand MAS were still beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = \n1.49; MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.12), with ACT being harmful to perceived recovery (ACT \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.68), serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = \n0.84) and free-testosterone (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.91).\nCONCLUSIONS: In recreational runners, a half-marathon results in fatigue \nsymptoms lasting at least 24h. To restore subjective fatigue measures, the \nauthors recommend CWI and MAS, as these recovery strategies are more effective \nthan PAS, with ACT being even disadvantageous.

Twenty-eight male \nsubjects [mean (SD) 23.8 (1.8) years] were randomly assigned to the control \n(COTG, n=10), cold-water immersion (CWIG, n=9), and double-cold-water immersion \ngroups (DCWIG, n=9). The cold-water immersion (15 min) was administered to the \nsubjects' legs after calf-raise exercise (CWIG: after recording initial \npost-exercise measures, DCWIG: after recording initial and 24 h post-exercise \nmeasures). Magnetic resonance T2-weighted images were obtained to calculate the \nT2 relaxation time (T2) of the triceps surae muscle before, immediately after, \nand at the following times post-exercise: 20, 40, and 60 min, and 24, 48, 96 and \n168 h. In addition, the ankle joint range of motion, serum creatine kinase and \nlactate dehydrogenase, and muscle soreness level were investigated before and \nafter exercise. In all groups, significant T2 elevations in the gastrocnemius \nmuscle appeared from immediately after to 60 min after exercise (P<0.05). \nThereafter, COTG showed significantly re-elevated T2 levels in the gastrocnemius \nat 96-168 h post-exercise (P<0.05), while CWIG and DCWIG showed significantly \nsmaller T2 values than the COTG at 96 h post-exercise (P<0.05). In addition, \nCOTG showed larger increases in serum enzymes at 96 h post-exercise (not \nsignificant) and significantly greater muscle soreness levels at 48 h \npost-exercise (P<0.05) than the cooling groups. The results of this study may \nsuggest that cooling has no dramatic effect, but some minor effects on reducing \nexercise-induced muscle edema in the subacute phase and relieving the extent of \nthe damaged muscle cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s00421-002-0749-3\nPMID: 12627305 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The use of \ncold-water immersion (CWI) as a recovery strategy is common; however, the \nphysiological and biochemical rationale behind its use remains unclear. This \nstudy aimed to assess the relationship between body temperature responses to \nwater immersion and individual perception of recovery, with subsequent exercise \nperformance.\nMETHODS: Twelve male rugby players participated in a 3-week cross-over trial \nwhere an intense 60 min conditioning session was followed immediately by 15 min \nof either 14°C CWI, 30°C warm-water immersion (WWI) or passive control (CON) \nrecovery intervention. Postexercise body temperatures and subjective ratings of \nthe recovery intervention were recorded and subsequently related to performance \nin a 5×40 m repeated sprint protocol undertaken 24 h later.\nRESULTS: CWI induced large reductions in core body temperature postimmersion \n(effect size (ES) range 1.05-3.21) and improved subsequent sprint performance \ncompared to WWI (ES 1.04±0.84) and CON (ES 1.44±0.84).

The running bouts (Ex1 and Ex2) were \nseparated by 15min of un-immersed seated rest (CON), hip-level CWI at 8°C \n(CWI-8) or hip-level CWI at 15°C (CWI-15).\nMETHODS: Intestinal temperature, blood lactate and heart rate were recorded \nthroughout and V˙O2, running economy and exercise times were recorded during the \nrunning sessions.\nRESULTS: Running time to failure (min) during Ex2 was significantly (p<0.05, \nES=0.7) longer following CWI-8 (27.7±6.3) than CON (23.3±5) but not different \nbetween CWI-15 (26.3±3.4) and CON (p=0.06, ES=0.7) or CWI-8 and CWI-15 (p=0.4, \nES=0.2). Qualitative analyses showed a 95% and 89% likely beneficial effect of \nCWI-8 and CWI-15 during Ex2 compared with CON, respectively. Time to failure \nduring Ex2 was significantly shorter than Ex1 only during the CON condition. \nIntestinal temperature and HR were significantly lower for most of Ex2 during \nCWI-8 and CWI-15 compared with CON but they were similar at failure for the \nthree conditions. Blood lactate, running economy and V˙O2 were not altered by \nCWI.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a 15min period of cold water immersion \napplied between repeated exhaustive exercise bouts significantly reduces \nintestinal temperature and enhances post-immersion running performance in \nnormothermic conditions.\n\nCopyright © 2012 Sports Medicine Australia.

In the passive rest trial, total \nwork (TW) and peak power (PP) were lower during the second half (TW: \n5.04 ± 1.11 kJ; PP: 929 ± 286 W) than the first half (TW: 5.66 ± 1.02 kJ; PP: \n1009 ± 266 W); while TW and PP were not different between halves following CWI-5 \n(first half, TW: 5.34 ± 1.02 kJ, PP: 1016 ± 283 W; second half, TW: \n5.19 ± 1.38 kJ; PP: 996 ± 318 W) and CWI-2.5 (first half, TW: 5.47 ± 1.19 kJ, \nPP: 966 ± 261 W; second half, TW: 5.25 ± 1.17 kJ; PP: 952 ± 231 W).

The players underwent performance tests \n(countermovement and 30 s continuous jumps and agility T) at 4 time points: at \nbaseline, immediately after rugby-specific exercise, post-recovery strategies \nand 12 h later. The performance of the agility and countermovement jump test \nwere not different between cold water immersion and control immediately post \nrugby-specific exercises and 12 h thereafter. However, the 30 s continuous jump \ntest performance decreased immediately but increased 12 h later after cold water \nimmersion compared with control.

On each occasion, they had to perform two climbing tests (C1 \nand C2) until volitional exhaustion on a prepracticed route (overhanging wall, \nlevel 6b). These two tests were separated by 20 min of recovery. Four recovery \nmethods were used in randomized order: passive recovery, active recovery (cycle \nergometer, 30-40 W), electromyostimulation on the forearm muscles (bisymmetric \nTENS current), or cold water immersion of the forearms and arms (three periods \nof 5 min at 15 +/- 1 degrees C). Climbing tests' performance was reflected by \nthe number of arm movements and climb duration.\nRESULTS: Using active recovery and cold water immersion, performance at C2 was \nmaintained in comparison with C1, whereas C2 performance was impaired compared \nwith C1 (P< 0.01) using electromyostimulation and passive recovery (recovery \nmethod-by-climb interaction, P < 0.05). Blood lactate decreased during recovery, \nwith the greatest decrease occurring during active recovery (time-by-recovery \nmethod interaction, P < 0.001). Arms and forearms' skin temperatures were lower \nthroughout the cold water immersion compared with the other three methods (P < \n0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Active recovery and cold water immersion are two means of preserving \nperformance when repeating acute exhausting climbing trails in female climbers. \nThese positive effects are accompanied by a greater lactate removal and a \ndecrease in subcutaneous tissues temperatures, respectively.\n\nDOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e318195107d\nPMID: 19461534 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Effect size data indicated trends \nfor an ameliorated decline in 5 x 20-m sprints and vertical jump for C(T)WT and \nCWI, respectively. C(T)WT demonstrated a significant reduction (p = 0.04) in \nlactate post-intervention compared to ACT recovery. Further, ACT recovery \nresulted in a significantly elevated (p < 0.01) heart rate compared to all other \nconditions postintervention and demonstrated significantly higher (p < 0.01) \nrating of perceived exertion postintervention and muscle soreness pre-exercise \nSession 2.

We investigated if this effect is apparent in normothermic conditions (∼19 \n°C), employing an intermittent high-intensity exercise designed to reflect the \nwork performed at the high-intensity domain in team sports. Fifteen young active \nmen completed 2 exhaustive cycling protocols (Ex1 and Ex2: 12 min at 85% \nventilatory threshold (VT) and then an intermittent exercise alternating 30-s at \n40% peak power (Ppeak) and 30 s at 90% Ppeak to exhaustion) separated by 15 min \nof (i) passive rest, (ii) 5-min cold-water immersion at 8 °C, and (iii) 10-min \ncold-water immersion at 8 °C. Core temperature, heart rate, rates of perceived \nexertion, and oxygen uptake kinetics were not different during Ex1 among \nconditions. Time to failure during the intermittent exercise was significantly \n(P < 0.05) longer during Ex2 following the 5- and 10-min cold-water immersions \n(7.2 ± 3.5 min and 7.3 ± 3.3 min, respectively) compared with passive rest (5.8 \n± 3.1 min). Core temperature, heart rate, and rates of perceived exertion were \nsignificantly (P < 0.05) lower during most periods of Ex2 after both cold-water \nimmersions compared with passive rest. The time constant of phase II oxygen \nuptake response during the 85% VT bout of Ex2 was not different among the 3 \nconditions.

Biochemical (tumor \nnecrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6), neuromuscular performance (squat \n(SJ) and countermovement jumps (CMJ), peak power output (PPO), rate of force \ndevelopment (RFD), stiffness, 10- and 30-m sprint time, and perceptual markers \n(soreness, perceived recovery) were obtained before and immediately after the \nmatch, and then at 30 min, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the match. Magnitude-based \ninference and Cohen's effect size (ES) were used to analyze change over time and \nbetween groups. Thus, the higher/beneficial, similar/trivial, or lower/harmful \ndifferences were evaluated as follows: <1%, almost certainly not; 1% to 5%, very \nunlikely; 5% to 25%, unlikely; 25% to 75%, possible; 75% to 95%, likely; 95% to \n99%, very likely; >99%, almost certainly.

Ten \nwell-trained swimmers (5 males, 5 females; 19.0 +/- 3.9 years) performed two \n100-m swimming sprints (S1 and S2) interspersed with a 30-min passive recovery \nperiod, during which athletes were randomly assigned to 5 min of CWI (14 degrees \nC) or an out-of-water control condition (CON 28 degrees C).

The purpose of this paper is to determine the influence of CWI \nimmediately following an Ironman triathlon on markers of muscle damage, \ninflammation and muscle soreness.\nDESIGN: Prospective cohort study.\nMETHODS: Thirty three (22 male, 11 female), triathletes participating in the \nIronman World Championships volunteered to participate (mean±SD: age=40±11years; \nheight=174.5±9.1cm; body mass=70±11.8kg; percent body fat=11.4±4.1%, finish \ntime=11:03.00±01:25.08). Post race, participants were randomly assigned to a \n10-min bout of 10°C CWI or no-intervention control group. Data collection \noccurred pre-intervention (PRE), post-intervention (POST), 16h (16POST) and 40h \n(40POST) following the race. Linear mixed model ANOVA with Bonferroni \ncorrections were performed to examine group by time differences for delayed \nonset muscle soreness (DOMS), hydration indices, myoglobin, creatine kinase \n(CK), cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and percent body mass loss \n(%BML). Pearson's bivariate correlations were used for comparisons with \nfinishing time. Alpha level was set a priori at 0.05.\nRESULTS: No significant group by time interactions occurred. Significant \ndifferences occurred for POST BML (-1.7±0.9kg) vs. 16POST, and 40POST BML \n(0.9±1.4, -0.1±1.2kg, respectively; p<0.001). Compared to PRE, myoglobin, CRP \nand CK remained significantly elevated at 40POST. Cortisol returned to PRE \nvalues by 16POST and IL-6 returned to PRE values by 40POST.\nCONCLUSION: A single bout of CWI did not provide any physiological benefit \nduring recovery from a triathlon within 40h post race. Effect of CWI beyond this \ntime is unknown.\n\nCopyright © 2018 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This \nstudy was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of IM and CMI on tissue \ntemperature and potential benefit to preventing DOMS. The research encompassed \n36 subjects divided into three groups of twelve depending on the form of \nrecovery: ice massage (IM), cold-water immersion (CWI), or passive recovery \n(PAS). All the participants were asked to jump as high as possible from a full \nsquat for one minute. Thermal imaging was conducted at rest, immediately \nfollowing the exercise, immediately after the trial, following the recovery \ntreatment, and after 30min of rest. Their pain levels were assessed using the \nVisual Analogue Scale (VAS). After applying the selected method for supporting \nrecovery, the LA level decreased by 4.25mmol/L in the IM group, and by \n4.96mmol/L in the CWI group (IM vs. CWI p>0.05). The 2.75mmol/L decrease in \nlactate concentration in the PAS group was significantly lower than in the other \ngroups (IM vs. PAS p<0.05/ CWI vs. PAS p<0.01). In both groups, Tsk after 30min \nwas significantly lower (ΔTsk~0.5°C) than at rest (p<0.05). In turn, Tsk in the \nPAS group returned to the resting values (p>0.05). Seventy-two hours after the \nexercise, a clear decrease in discomfort was observed in the IM and CWI groups \ncompared to the PAS group. The two applied treatments have proven to be \neffective both in utilizing lactate and preventing DOMS. Depending on training \nrequirements, we recommend the use of IM when athletes experience localized \nmuscle fatigue. One the other hand, CWI is recommended in situations of global \nor generalized muscle injury or fatigue.\n\nCopyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

After performing a bout of damage-inducing eccentric exercise (eight \nsets of five maximal reciprocal contractions at 0.58 rad x s(-1)) of the elbow \nflexors on an isokinetic dynamometer, 15 females aged 22.0+/-2.0 years (mean +/- \ns) were allocated to a control group (no treatment, n = 7) or a cryotherapy \ngroup (n = 8). Subjects in the cryotherapy group immersed their exercised arm in \ncold water (15 degrees C) for 15 min immediately after eccentric exercise and \nthen every 12 h for 15 min for a total of seven sessions. Muscle tenderness, \nplasma creatine kinase activity, relaxed elbow angle, isometric strength and \nswelling (upper arm circumference) were measured immediately before and for 3 \ndays after eccentric exercise. Analysis of variance revealed significant (P < \n0.05) main effects for time for all variables, with increases in muscle \ntenderness, creatine kinase activity and upper arm circumference, and decreases \nin isometric strength and relaxed elbow angle. There were significant \ninteractions (P<0.05) of group x time for relaxed elbow angle and creatine \nkinase activity. Relaxed elbow angle was greater and creatine kinase activity \nlower for the cryotherapy group than the controls on days 2 and 3 following the \neccentric exercise. We conclude that although cold water immersion may reduce \nmuscle stiffness and the amount of post-exercise damage after strenuous \neccentric activity, there appears to be no effect on the perception of \ntenderness and strength loss, which is characteristic after this form of \nactivity.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/026404199366136\nPMID: 10362390 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Enhancing recovery from resistance training may improve \nthe muscle-remodeling processes, stimulating a faster return to peak \nperformance.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of 2 different recovery modalities, \nneuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and cold-water immersion (CWI), on \nperformance and biochemical and ultrasonographic measures.\nPARTICIPANTS: Thirty resistance-trained men (23.1 ± 2.9 y, 175.2 ± 7.1 cm, 82.1 \n± 8.4 kg) were randomly assigned to NMES, CWI, or control (CON).\nDESIGN AND SETTING: All participants completed a high-volume lower-body \nresistance-training workout on d 1 and returned to the human performance \nlaboratory 24 (24H) and 48 h (48 H) postexercise for follow-up testing.\nMEASURES: Blood samples were obtained preexercise (PRE) and immediately (IP), 30 \nmin (30 P), 24 h (24H), and 48 h (48 H) post. Subjects were examined for \nperformance changes in the squat exercise (total repetitions and average power \nper repetition), biomarkers of inflammation, and changes in cross-sectional area \nand echo intensity (EI) of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis muscles.\nRESULTS: No differences between groups were observed in the number of \nrepetitions (P = .250; power: P = .663). Inferential-based analysis indicated \nthat increases in C-reactive protein concentrations were likely increased by a \ngreater magnitude after CWI compared with CON, while NMES possibly decreased \nmore than CON from IP to 24H. Increases in interleukin-10 concentrations between \nIP and 30 P were likely greater in CWI than NMES but not different from CON. \nInferential-based analysis of RF EI indicated a likely decrease for CWI between \nIP and 48 H. No other differences between groups were noted in any other \nmuscle-architecture measures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that CWI induced greater increases in pro- and \nanti-inflammatory markers, while decreasing RF EI, suggesting that CWI may be \neffective in enhancing short-term muscle recovery after high-volume bouts of \nresistance exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1123/jsr.2013-0113\nPMID: 24622577 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Nevertheless, the effects of CWI using \ndifferent temperatures and the dose-response relationship of this technique have \nnot yet been investigated. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of \ntwo strategies of CWI, using different water temperatures with passive recovery \npost exercise in the management of some markers of muscle damage, and to observe \nwhether any of the techniques used caused deleterious effects on performance. \nSixty healthy male participants performed an eccentric protocol to induce muscle \ndamage and were then randomized to one of three groups (CWI1: 15 min at 9 °C; \nCWI2: 15 min at 14 °C; CG: control group). Levels of creatine kinase, muscle \nsoreness, pain threshold, perception of recovery, and maximal voluntary \nisometric contraction were monitored up to 96 h post exercise. A large effect \nfor time for all outcomes was observed [P < 0.001; CK (ES = 0.516), muscle \nsoreness (ES = 0.368); pain threshold (ES = 0.184); perception of recovery \n(ES = 0.565); MVIC (ES = 0.273)]. CWI groups presented an earlier recovery for \nmuscle soreness with lower ratings immediately post recovery. For delayed \neffects, the application of CWI2 (15 min at 14 °C) presented earlier recovery \ncompared with CWI1 and control condition for maximal voluntary isometric \ncontraction (P < 0.05). There were no significant group and interaction (Group × \nTime) effects. CWI groups acted more efficiently for muscle soreness and \nperformance considering the time of recovery was observed. No evidence was found \nto suggest dose-response relationship and deleterious effects.\n\n© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

There are several interventions available for exercise induced \nmuscle damage recovery, but cold-water immersion (CWI) stands out among them. \nThe effects of CWI are unclear in the literature and, although the number of \nstreet runners has been growing, there is a gap in the scientific evidence \nregarding the use of CWI to recover runners' performance after a 10-km street \nrun. Purpose: The goal of our study was to analyze the effects of CWI on the \nrecovery of muscle damage markers after a 10-km street run. Method: We randomly \nassigned thirty male recreational street runners, immediately after a 10-km \nstreet run, into three recovery groups: control (rest for 10 minutes), immersion \n(10 min immersed in water without ice at room temperature) and CWI (10 min \nimmersed in water with ice at 10ºC). We assessed pain, triple hop distance, \nextensor peak torque and blood creatine kinase levels pre- and post-run, \npost-intervention and 24 hours after the run. Results: The 10-km run was enough \nto decrease triple hop distance and extensor peak torque, and increase levels of \ncreatine kinase (p < 0.05); however, we found no time/group interactions in any \nof the assessed variables after we applied the appropriate interventions (p > \n0.05). Conclusion: 10-min CWI at 10°C was no more effective than water immersion \nand rest in recovering muscle damage markers after 10-km runs.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/02701367.2019.1659477\nPMID: 31652109 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Eight men (age 23 ± 3 years; \nstature 190.5 ± 8.9 cm; body mass 90.3 ± 9.6 kg; body fat 12.8 ± 4.8%) and eight \nwomen (age 22 ± 2 years; stature 179.0 ± 8.5 cm; body mass 77.6 ± 9.2 kg; body \nfat 22.5 ± 6.6%) basketball players participated. Massage, cold-water immersion \nor control were applied immediately after competitive matches, followed by \nassessments of perceptual measures of recovery and physical performance, \ncountermovement jump and repeated-sprint ability 24 h after intervention. There \nwas lower perception of fatigue overall and in the legs immediately after the \nmassage and cold-water immersion condition (P < 0.001; η²(P) = 0.91). \nFurthermore, women had a lower perception of fatigue in cold-water immersion \nthan massage at any testing time (P < 0.001; η²(P) = 0.37).

There was no effect of any of the recovery interventions on \nrepeated-sprint measures (P at best 0.067, η²(P) at best 0.68). The results \nsuggest that both massage and cold-water immersion improve perceptual measures \nof recovery. Furthermore, cold-water immersion improves jump performance \nalthough neither such immersion nor massage had an effect on repeated-sprint \nability.

After \nweek 1 training, all players completed a passive recovery (PAS). During week 2, \nCOLD or CWT was randomly assigned. Players undertook the opposing intervention \nin week 3. Repeat-sprint ability (6 × 20 m), countermovement and squat jumps, \nperceived muscle soreness, and fatigue were measured pretraining and over 48 h \nposttraining.\nRESULTS: Immediately posttraining, groups exhibited similar performance and \npsychometric declines. At 24 h, repeat-sprint time had deteriorated by 4.1% for \nPAS and 1.0% for CWT but was fully restored by COLD (0.0%). At 24 and 48 h, both \nCOLD and CWT attenuated changes in mean muscle soreness, with COLD (0.6 ± 0.6 \nand 0.0 ± 0.4) more effective than CWT (1.9 ± 0.7 and 1.0 ± 0.7) and PAS having \nminimal effect (5.5 ± 0.6 and 4.0 ± 0.5).

Treatments were reversed in the second \nsession (after 1 week).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine \naminotransferase enzymes; perceived muscle soreness; and recovery through visual \nanalogue scales and muscle power of the upper and lower limbs at pretraining, \npostrecovery, 24 hours, and 48 hours.\nRESULTS: Athletes who underwent CWI showed better posttraining recovery measures \nbecause circulating LDH levels were lower at 24 hours postrecovery in the CWI \ncondition (441.9 ± 81.4 IU/L) than in the control condition (493.6 ± 97.4 IU/L; \nP = .03). Estimated muscle power was higher in the CWI than in the control \ncondition for both upper limbs (757.9 ± 125.1 W versus 695.9 ± 56.1 W) and lower \nlimbs (53.7 ± 3.7 cm versus 35.5 ± 8.2 cm; both P values = .001). In addition, \nwe observed less perceived muscle soreness (1.5 ± 1.1 arbitrary units [au] \nversus 3.1 ± 1.0 au; P = .004) and higher perceived recovery (8.8 ± 1.9 au \nversus 6.9 ± 1.7 au; P = .005) in the CWI than in the control condition at 24 \nhours postrecovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of CWI can be beneficial to jiu-jitsu athletes because it \nreduces circulating LDH levels, results in less perceived muscle soreness, and \nhelps muscle power recovery at 24 hours postrecovery.\n\nDOI: 10.4085/1062-6050-51.9.01\nPMCID: PMC5317190\nPMID: 27575565 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In this research, we evaluated hydrotherapy for \nrecovery from a simulated game of rugby union tracked over a week of training. \nTwenty-four experienced male rugby union players (mean ± SD age 19.46 ± 0.82 \nyears, weight 82.38 ± 11.12 kg, height 178.54 ± 5.75 cm) were randomly divided \ninto 3 groups: cold water immersion (n = 8), contrast bath therapy (n = 8), and \na control group (n = 8). The 2 forms of hydrotherapy were administered \nimmediately after a simulated rugby game. Testing was conducted 1 hour before \nthe game and at 5 intervals postgame: 1, 48, 72, 96, and 144 hours. Dependent \nvariables included countermovement jump, 10- and 40-m sprints, sessional rating \nof perceived exertion (RPE), flexibility, thigh circumference, and self-reported \ndelayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Significant differences in DOMS were found \nbetween the cold water immersion and contrast bath groups at 48 hours post \nintervention (p = 0.02), and between the control and contrast bath groups at 72 \n(p = 0.03) and 96 (p = 0.04) hours post intervention. Cold water immersion and \ncontrast bath groups reported significantly different RPE at 72 hours (p = ?) \nand 96 hours post (p = 0.05) intervention.

Repeated sprint ability, strength, muscle soreness and inflammatory \nmarkers were measured across the 48-h post-exercise period. Eleven male \nteam-sport athletes completed three 3-day testing trials, each separated by 2 \nweeks. On day 1, baseline measures of performance (10 m x 20 m sprints and \nisometric strength of quadriceps, hamstrings and hip flexors) were recorded. \nParticipants then performed 80 min of simulated team sports exercise followed by \na 20-m shuttle run test to exhaustion. Upon completion of the exercise, and 24h \nlater, participants performed one of the post-exercise recovery procedures for \n15 min. At 48 h post-exercise, the performance tests were repeated. Blood \nsamples and muscle soreness ratings were taken before and immediately after \npost-exercise, and at 24h and 48 h post-exercise. In comparison to the control \nand CWI treatments, COLD resulted in significantly lower (p<0.05) muscle \nsoreness ratings, as well as in reduced decrements to isometric leg extension \nand flexion strength in the 48-h post-exercise period.

The ISE consisted of a 15-m \nsprint every minute separated by self-paced bouts of hard running, jogging, and \nwalking for the remainder of the minute. Every sixth rotation, participants \nperformed 5 × 10-m runs, receiving a shoulder-led tackle to the lower body on \neach effort. Sprint time and distance covered during ISE were recorded, with \nvoluntary (maximal voluntary contraction; MVC) and evoked neuromuscular function \n(voluntary activation; VA), electromyogram (root mean square (RMS)), ratings of \nperceived muscle soreness (MS), capillary and venous blood markers for \nmetabolites and muscle damage, respectively measured before and after exercise, \nimmediately after recovery, and 2 and 24 h after recovery.\nRESULTS: Total distance covered during exercise was significantly greater in \nCONT (P = 0.01), without differences between TPASS and TCWI (P > 0.05). TCWI \nresulted in increased MVC, VA, and RMS immediately after recovery (P < 0.05). \nM-wave amplitude and peak twitch were significantly increased after recovery and \n2 h after recovery, respectively, in TCWI (P < 0.05). Although TCWI had no \neffect on the elevation in blood markers for muscle damage (P > 0.05), lactate \nwas significantly reduced after recovery compared with TPASS (P = 0.04). CWI \nalso resulted in reduced MS 2 h after recovery compared with TPASS (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The introduction of body contact reduces exercise performance, \nwhereas the use of CWI results in a faster recovery of MVC, VA, and RMS and \nimproves muscle contractile properties and perceptions of soreness after \ncollision-based exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31822b0977\nPMID: 21716151 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The recovery intervention consisted of different water \nimmersion techniques, including: temperate water immersion (36°C; TWI), cold \nwater immersion (10°C; CWI), contrast water temperature (10-42°C; CWT) and a \npassive recovery (PAS). Performances during a maximal 30-s rowing test (P(30 \ns)), a maximal vertical counter-movement jump (CMJ) and a maximal isometric \nvoluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensor muscles were measured at rest \n(Pre-exercise), immediately after the exercise (Post-exercise), 1 h after (Post \n1 h) and 24 h later (Post 24 h). Leukocyte profile and venous blood markers of \nmuscle damage (creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were also \nmeasured Pre-exercise, Post 1 h and Post 24 h. A significant time effect was \nobserved to indicate a reduction in performance (Pre-exercise vs. Post-exercise) \nfollowing the exercise bout in all conditions (P < 0.05). Indeed, at 1 h post \nexercise, a significant improvement in MVC and P(30 s) was respectively observed \nin the CWI and CWT groups compared to pre-exercise.

Twenty-two \nhealthy Division I collegiate soccer players (13 men and 9 women; age, 19.8 ± \n1.1 years; height, 174.0 ± 9.0 cm; mass, 72.1 ± 9.1 kg) volunteered as \nparticipants during the noncompetitive season.

Circulating \nmediators of the inflammatory response were measured from EDTA plasma taken \npre-exercise (baseline), immediately post-exercise, and at 2, 24, and 48 h \npost-exercise. Ratings of perceived soreness and impairment were noted on a \n10-pt Likert scale, and squat jump and drop jump were performed at these time \npoints.\nRESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, and MPO increased significantly from baseline immediately \npost-exercise in all conditions. IL-6 remained elevated from baseline at 2 h in \nthe CWI-30 min × 20 °C, CWI-10 min × 10 °C, and CWI-30 min × 10 °C conditions, \nwhile further increases were observed for IL-8 and MPO in the CWI-30 min × 20 °C \nand CWI-30 min × 10 °C conditions.

However, \nrecent reports have cautioned that CWI may attenuate the adaptive response to \nresistance training.\nPURPOSE: To determine the effect of post resistance-exercise CWI on circulating \nfree testosterone (T) and cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α) response.\nMETHODS: Using a randomized and counterbalanced repeated-measures design, 11 \nresistance-trained men completed two workouts (6 sets of 10 repetitions of back \nsquats at 80% of maximum load) a week apart after which they took part in either \n15 min of CWI (15 °C) or passive recovery. T, IL-6, and TNFα were measured in \nblood samples taken before (PRE) and 5 (5POST), 15 (15POST), 30 (30POST), and 60 \n(60POST) min post-exercise and compared between treatments and over time.\nRESULTS: For T, a significant interaction effect of condition over time \n(p = 0.030) as well as greater relative concentrations of T in CON (Δ9.2%) than \nCWI (Δ-0.5%, p = 0.049) at 30POST were observed. In addition, at 60POST, T \ndropped below PRE values in CWI (Δ-10.4%, p = 0.028) but not in CON (Δ-1.6%, \np = 0.850). A suppressed cytokine response was observed after CWI in IL-6 at \n30POST (CWI: Δ4.9%, CON: Δ47.5%, p = 0.041) and TNFα at 15POST (CWI: Δ5.3%, CON: \nΔ17.0%, p = 0.022).\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI blunted the T and cytokine response after a bout of resistance \nexercise. These results indicate that CWI results in an altered anabolic \nresponse and may help to explain the previous observation of attenuated \nhypertrophy when CWI is used after resistance exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1007/s00421-019-04178-7\nPMID: 31222379 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Electronic address: marius.brazaitis@lsu.lt.\n\nA poor outcome of whole-body hypothermia often results from a late complication, \nrather than from acute effects of hypothermia. A low body (cell) temperature or \nthe increase in the concentrations of the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, \nand norepinephrine in response to acute cold stress have been proposed as potent \nproinflammatory cytokine suppressant. In the current study, we tested the \nhypothesis that the recovery of body temperature from a whole-body intermittent \ncold-water immersion (CWI, at 13-14 °C for a total 170 min) is associated with a \ndelayed response of proinflammatory cytokines in young healthy men. Our results \nrevealed a delay in the increase in the proinflammatory interleukin 6 and \ninterleukin 1β cytokines after the CWI, which paralleled the changes in \ncortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and body temperature. CWI decreased tumor \nnecrosis factor α (TNF-α) immediately and 1 h after the CWI. Although TNF-α had \nrecovered to the pre-immersion level at 2 h after CWI, its natural circadian \ncycle kinetics was disrupted until 12 h after the CWI. Furthermore, we showed \nthat CWI strongly modified the white blood cell counts, with changes reaching a \npeak between 1 and 2 h after the CWI.\n\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Submaximal muscle function was assessed after 6 h by measuring \nthe average load lifted during 6 sets of 10 squats at 80% of 1 repetition \nmaximum. Intramuscular temperature (1 cm) was also recorded, and venous blood \nsamples were analyzed for markers of metabolism, vasoconstriction, and muscle \ndamage. CWI did not enhance recovery of maximal muscle function. However, during \nthe final three sets of the submaximal muscle function test, participants lifted \na greater load (P < 0.05, Cohen's effect size: 1.3, 38%) after CWI compared with \nactive recovery. During CWI, muscle temperature decreased ∼7°C below \npostexercise values and remained below preexercise values for another 35 min. \nVenous blood O2 saturation decreased below preexercise values for 1.5 h after \nCWI.

However, few studies have compared the effect of \ndifferent cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice \nmassage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural \n(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.\nDESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were \nrandomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent \nvariables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. \nDependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.\nMETHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) \nyears, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold \nmodalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature \nand nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after \ncooling.\nRESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There \nalso was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the \ncompound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion \nreduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m/s and \nmotor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the \nmost effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.\nLIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than \nthat of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment \ngroup. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.\nCONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and \nchanging sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to \ninduce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as \napplied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic \neffects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.\n\nDOI: 10.2522/ptj.20090131\nPMID: 20185615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

If there's no place to swim outdoors, he suggests taking increasingly cooler showers or baths at home, as well as exercising outside.\nThe most dangerous time is the first 10 seconds to a minute, when people try to get their breath under control, Hill said. \"You can survive for up to an hour moving around but for those who are not accustomed to that cold water shock, it can be incredibly risky.\"\nThe risk for hypothermia continues when you get out of the water, he said. \"You should immediately get out of cold, wet clothes and into warm ones. Get near a space heater and drink a warm beverage.\"\nHill cautioned against doing a cold water swim without medical personnel on hand and access to supplies that allow immediate rewarming.\n\"Never, ever do a cold water swim on your own,\" he said. \"That is a recipe for disaster.\"",
