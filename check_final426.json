Thirty healthy women (23.3 \u00b1 2.9 years) were randomly assigned to either the CWI, HWI, or control (CON) groups. Participants completed a standardised exercise protocol (5 x 20 drop-jumps), followed by a 10\u2009min recovery intervention (CWI, HWI, or CON) immediately and 120\u2009min post-exercise. Physiological responses, including muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2), core and skin temperature, and heart rate, were assessed at baseline, immediately post-exercise, after the first recovery intervention (postInt), and during 30\u2009min follow-up. Recovery was evaluated through maximal voluntary isometric contraction, muscle swelling, muscle soreness ratings, and serum creatine kinase at baseline, 24, 48, and 72\u2009h post-exercise. A mixed-effects model was used to account for repeated measures over time. Results showed lower SmO2 values in the CWI compared to the HWI group at 20\u2009min (\u0394-6.76%, CI: \u22120.27 to \u221213.25, p = 0.038) and 30\u2009min (\u0394-9.86%, CI: \u22123.37 to \u221216.35, p = 0.001), and compared to CON at 30\u2009min (\u0394-7.28%, CI: \u221213.77 to \u22120.79, p = 0.022). Core temperature was significantly higher in the HWI than the CWI group (postInt and 30\u2009min), while it was significantly lower in the CWI group than CON (30\u2009min). CWI caused a substantial decrease in skin temperature compared to HWI and CON between postInt and 30\u2009min follow-up (all p < 0.001). Skin temperature was higher in the HWI group compared to CON at postInt and throughout 30\u2009min follow-up (all p < 0.001). No significant differences in recovery markers were observed between CWI and HWI groups, although HWI led to slightly higher creatine kinase levels (24\u2009h and 72\u2009h) and greater muscle swelling (24\u2009h) compared to CON. Despite distinct acute physiological responses to CWI and HWI, neither improved subjective or objective recovery outcomes during the 72\u2009h follow-up compared to CON in women following a muscle-damaging exercise protocol.\nCopyright: \u00a9 2025 Wellauer et al.

However, its effectiveness in restoring neuromuscular function remains \ninconclusive. This study examined the impact of CWI on recovery following \nhigh-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Twelve young, recreationally active \nindividuals (10 males, 2 females) participated in a randomized crossover study. \nEach session included six sets of 30-s all-out isokinetic concentric \ncontractions of the ankle dorsiflexor and plantar flexor muscles, followed by \n10\u2009min of room temperature rest (RT) or CWI at 10\u00b0C. Neuromuscular function and \nintramuscular temperature were evaluated periodically over 24\u2009h, as well as \nnext-day fatigue resistance of the dorsiflexors. In both conditions, maximal \nvoluntary contraction torque remained impaired for up to 3\u2009h without significant \nchanges in voluntary activation (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Electrically stimulated torque \nshowed no difference in the fatigue-induced decline or recovery of 10\u2009Hz torque, \nwhich also remained impaired for up to 3\u2009h. However, 50\u2009Hz torque recovered \nwithin 1\u2009h following RT, whereas it remained slightly reduced for up to 3\u2009h \nfollowing CWI. The 10:50\u2009Hz torque ratio showed immediate recovery with CWI, \nwhereas RT recovery was delayed for up to 1\u2009h. Notably, the ratio was \nsignificantly lower with RT at 0-, 0.5-, and 1-h post-intervention. Despite \nthese differences, HIIE performance during a repeat bout conducted 24\u2009h later \nremained similar.

However, less is known about the effectiveness of \nonline social support. Disparities in availability of and access to in-person \nsocial support could make online social support a promising and cost-effective \nalternative. To this end we aimed to compare the effects of online versus \nin-person social support on pain induced with a cold-pressor task (CPT). \nSpecifically, 62 pain-free female participants immersed their feet in cold water \n(1) alone, (2) in the physical presence of a supportive other, (3) while \nchatting with the supportive other online, and (4) while chatting online with a \nstranger, in a randomized order. We assessed self-reported pain intensity, pain \nunpleasantness, and threat value of pain, as well as pain tolerance (i.e. \nimmersion time) and heart rate. Overall, pain intensity and unpleasantness \nratings were higher in the alone condition compared to the other conditions. A \nsimilar pattern was found in pain tolerance, but the differences were not \nstatistically significant. Heart rate increased during the CPT but was highest \nin the in-person support condition. Moreover, recovery after cold water \nimmersion was slower in the alone condition compared to the other conditions. In \nsum, interaction with a supportive other or a stranger, be it online or \nin-person, led to a reduction in acute pain compared to being alone. This study \npresents initial evidence that online interaction with others might be an \neffective alternative to in-person social support in order to reduce acute pain \nin women. PERSPECTIVE: Online and in-person social support were equally \neffective in reducing acute experimental cold-pressor pain compared to being \nalone. There was no difference between social support from strangers or a \nsupportive other.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite these \nbenefits, there is emerging evidence to suggest the temperature of the water \nexposure can influence energy intake in the subsequent hours. The study aim was \nto investigate the influence of water temperature on energy expenditure and \npost-water immersion ad-libitum energy intake in resting adults. Participants \nwith a range of body masses, but otherwise healthy and physically active males \n(n = 10) and females (n = 5), participated in three randomised trials in a \nrepeated measures crossover design, with a minimum of 7-days apart. Participants \nwere immersed to sternum level for 30-minutes in either cold-water (16 \u00b0C), \nthermoneutral-water (35 \u00b0C) or a no-water thermoneutral ambient air control (26 \n\u00b0C). Participants completed appetite related visual analogue scales throughout \nand were presented with an ad-libitum homogenous pasta meal and asked to eat \nuntil 'comfortably full'.\nRESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA showed participants consumed more energy after \nimmersion in cold-water (2783 \u00b1 909 kJ) versus both thermoneutral-water (1817 \u00b1 \n862 kJ) and thermoneutral ambient air (1894 \u00b1 233 kJ). There were no differences \nin any of the appetite VAS. Core temperature remained stable throughout the 30 \nmin immersion period across trials, however an after-drop in core temperature \nwas observed for 15 mins following cold-water immersion when compared to both \nthermoneutral water (P < 0.001), and thermoneutral air (P = 0.004). Although the \nexact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, further research is required to \nidentify if the after-drop in core temperature is a potential mechanism \nresponsible for compensatory food intake post cold-water immersion.\nCONCLUSION: When presented with an ad-libitum meal directly after cold-water \nimmersion, participants consumed more in comparison to both thermoneutral water \nimmersion and thermoneutral ambient air. With cold water immersion becoming \npopular, these findings have practical and clinical relevance for individuals' \nconscious about body mass management.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025.

No differences between groups were observed in \nany other measures.\nCONCLUSION: Multiple cold-water immersions at 10\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min decreases CK \nconcentration but does not change any clinical and neuromuscular markers of \nmuscle damage in soccer players during a 9-day preseason.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The patients received an active lingual nerve block \n(lidocaine) and a placebo injection (saline) randomly with an interval of 1\u2009week \nin a double-blinded manner. Patients evaluated their pain intensity on a 0- to \n10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) before and after each injection, with or \nwithout CPM. Based on the anaesthesia effect, BMS patients were divided into two \ngroups with presumed different pain mechanisms; a 'central subgroup (n\u2009=\u200911)' \nwith pain relief less than 1\u2009cm and 'peripheral subgroup (n\u2009=\u20099)' with pain \nrelief more than 1\u2009cm on the VAS. Mechanical pain threshold (MPT) and wind-up \nratio (WUR) were investigated at two oral mucosa regions: the region with most \nintense symptoms and a control region for the patient group; tongue and buccal \nregion for the control group. CPM was induced by immersing the left hand into \ncold water. A moderate level of pain (around five on the VAS) was obtained by \nadjusting the water temperature. MPT and WUR were measured twice for all the \nparticipants with and without CPM, which was analysed and presented as relative \nchange in MPT and WUR. Differences between groups were analysed using two-way \nANOVA. Differences within group between tests were assessed by paired t-test.\nRESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant group differences for MPT or WUR \nbetween BMS patients and healthy controls (p\u2009\u2265\u20090.156). The mean bath temperature \nto evoke moderate pain for the BMS group was significantly lower than that for \nthe healthy control group (8.9\u00b0C vs. 11.9\u00b0C, p\u2009=\u20090.003). The CPM evoked an \ninhibitory modulation in 18.2%-44.4% of BMS patients, while for the healthy \ngroup, the ratio was 68.2%-81.8%. Central BMS patients had smaller CPM effects \nthan healthy participants at the painful site and control site, which indicated \na decreased CPM function (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.034). Peripheral BMS patients had lower CPM \neffects than healthy participants only at the painful site (p\u2009=\u20090.037).\nCONCLUSIONS: The present findings documented impairment of central nociceptive \ninhibition processing in BMS patients which was more extensive in central BMS \nthan peripheral BMS. These findings add to the suggestion that BMS may a \nheterogeneous pain condition with at least two different phenotypes.\n\n\u00a9 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1111\/joor.13876\nPMID: 39496500 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Building on this, \nthe hypothesis was formulated that the execution of repeated maximal BH efforts \nmight lead to subsequent enhancements in performance during a time-to-exhaustion \ntest.\nMETHODS: This study investigated the acute effects of five static maximal \nbreath-holding maneuvers conducted with face immersion in cold water (10\u00a0\u00b0C) on \nsubsequent graded exercise test (GET) performance. Seventeen well-trained \nparticipants completed a GET on a motorized treadmill under two randomized \ncross-over conditions: baseline measurement (CON) and after five repeated \nmaximal breath-holding efforts (EXP).\nRESULTS: The GET protocol consists of incremental increases in speed until \nexhaustion. After the fifth breath-hold, participants in the EXP condition \nexhibited significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05) increases in hematocrit, hemoglobin \nconcentration, red blood cell count, and muscle deoxygenation, accompanied by a \nreduction in blood lactate concentration (4.09\u2009\u00b1\u20092.21%, 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.76%, \n3.96\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1%, 81.48\u2009\u00b1\u200923.83%, and 15.22\u2009\u00b1\u200917.64%, respectively), compared to CON. \nDuring GET, the EXP condition showed a significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05) delayed onset \ntime of the second ventilatory threshold (3.14\u2009\u00b1\u20095.85%) and (P\u2009<\u20090.05) increased \ntime to exhaustion (0.75\u2009\u00b1\u20091.02%).\nCONCLUSION: This evidence suggests that repeated maximal static breath-holding \nmaneuvers enhance the oxygen delivery system by increasing the circulation of \nreserve red blood cells, heightened muscle oxygen deoxygenation, enhanced \naerobic metabolism utilization, and postponing the transition from aerobic to \nanaerobic metabolism, implying a potential ergogenic effect. While pre-exercise \nbreath-holding shows promise for improving time-to-exhaustion and optimizing \nsubsequent distance running performance, further in-depth investigation is \nessential to fully elucidate the underlying mechanistic factors.\n\n\u00a9 2024.

The aim of this study was to compare the \nextent of pain inhibition from exercise-induced hypoalgesia (isometric wall \nsquat), conditioned pain modulation (cold-water immersion), and their \ncombination (wall squat followed by cold water in fixed order) in healthy \npain-free adults. Sixty-one participants (median age 21 years) completed 3 \nsessions (wall-squat, cold-water, and\u00a0combined) in random order. Sessions were \nseparated by at least a week. In each session, pressure-pain thresholds, \nsingle-pinprick-pain ratings, and pinprick-temporal summation of pain (the fifth \nminus the first) were obtained at quadriceps, forearms, and forehead, before and \nafter wall squat and\/or cold water. Each intervention inhibited pain to pressure \n(partial \u03b72 =\u00a0.26) and single pinprick (partial \u03b72 =\u00a0.16) to a similar extent; \nhowever, pressure-pain inhibition was negligible in the forehead. After \nadjusting for age and sex, single-pinprick-pain inhibition in the forehead \ninduced by wall squat was associated with that induced by cold water (adjusted \nR2 =\u00a0.15;\u00a0P\u00a0=\u00a0.007), and stronger pain inhibition was predicted by a higher \nthigh-pain rating to wall squat (adjusted R2 =\u00a0.10;\u00a0P\u00a0=\u00a0.027). Neither \nintervention affected pinprick-temporal summation of pain. Together, the \nfindings suggest that pain-inhibitory effects of exercise-induced hypoalgesia \nand conditioned pain modulation may overlap when exercise is at least moderately \npainful (6\/10 intensity). Pressure pain in body regions remote from the \nexercised or conditioned sites may be weakly modulated. PERSPECTIVE: The current \nfindings suggest that pain-inhibitory effects induced by painful wall squat and \nby cold-water immersion may overlap. The magnitude of pain inhibition in the \nforehead remote from the exercised thigh or the conditioned foot appears \nsmaller, which could be examined further in future research.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 United States Association for the Study of Pain, Inc.

While we recently showed \nthat these strategies do not limit core temperature increases in older adults \nduring prolonged heat exposure, we did observe small reductions in heart rate. \nExpanding on these findings, we examined the effects of foot immersion with and \nwithout neck cooling on cardiac autonomic function. Seventeen adults (9 females; \n65-81 years) underwent 3 randomized, 6 h exposures to 38 \u00b0C and 35% relative \nhumidity with: no cooling (control), foot immersion (20\u00a0\u00b0C water), or foot \nimmersion with a wet towel (20\u00a0\u00b0C) around the neck. Cardiac autonomic responses \nwere measured at baseline and end-exposure. These included heart rate \nvariability, cardiac and systolic blood pressure responses to standing, indexed \nvia the 30:15 ratio and supine-to-standing systolic pressure change, \nrespectively, and baroreflex sensitivity during repeated sit-to-stand maneuvers. \nThe 30:15 ratio was 0.04 [95% CI: 0.01, 0.07] greater with foot immersion and \nneck cooling (1.08 (SD: 0.04)) relative to control (1.04 (0.06); P\u00a0=\u00a00.018). \nSimilarly, standing systolic blood pressure was elevated 9 [0, 17] mmHg with \nfoot immersion and neck cooling (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). That said, neither difference \nremained statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity \n(Padjusted\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.054).

Gastrointestinal temperature was \ntracked throughout HWI 41 . Knee extensors' maximal isokinetic strength (peak \ntorque ( Tpeak )) and explosive strength (late-phase rate of force development \n(RFD 100-200 )) were measured before EIMD (pre-), 24 h (post-24 h), and 48 h \n(post-48 h) post-EIMD. In addition, pressure pain threshold (PPT) was measured \nto quantify the recovery from muscle soreness. Surface electromyography signals \n(sEMG) from the vastus lateralis were captured to extract the rates of \nelectromyography rise (REMGR) and the spectral power in the low-frequency band.\nRESULTS: At post-48 h, Tpeak returned to baseline values following both CWI 11 \n(-8.3% \u00b1 6.8%, P = 0.079) and HWI 41 (-1.4% \u00b1 4.1%, P = 1). In contrast, RFD \n100-200 (-2.3% \u00b1 29.3%, P = 1) and PPT (+5.6% \u00b1 14.6%, P = 1) returned to \nbaseline values at post-48 h only following HWI 41 . Spectral analysis of the \nsEMG signal revealed that the low-frequency band was significantly increased \nfollowing CWI 11 (+9.0% \u00b1 0.52%, P = 0.012). REMGR was unchanged regardless of \nthe condition (all P > 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: A single session of HWI 41 , rather than CWI 11 , improved the \nrecovery of the late-phase rate of force development following EIMD in \nphysically active males. This suggests that in athletic contexts where a rapid \nforce development is a key performance determinant, hot bath should be preferred \nover cold bath.\n\nPublisher: PURPOSE: In recent years, there has been significant advancement in \nthe guidelines for recovery protocols involving heat or cold water immersion. \nHowever, comparison between the effects of hot and cold water immersion on key \nmarkers of neuromuscular recovery following exercise-induced muscle damage \n(EIMD) is lacking.\nMETHODS: Thirty physically active males completed an individualized and tailored \nEIMD protocol immediately followed by one of the following recovery \ninterventions: cold water immersion (11\u00b0C, CWI 11 ), hot water immersion (41\u00b0C, \nHWI 41 ), or warm-bath control (36\u00b0C, CON 36 ).

Although the \nremaining outcomes were not significantly different, they favored the AHCWI \ngroup. Notably, a significant difference was observed in the BI at 4 weeks \n(P=.032). Significant changes in the muscle tone or adverse effects were not \nobserved in either group after the intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS: AHCWI with stroke rehabilitation is feasible and may facilitate \nmotor function recovery of the paretic UL after a stroke.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

In a randomized crossover single-blind design, 12 \nhealthy adults (27\u2009\u00b1\u20092 yr, 2 women) completed 1 h of cold (22.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u00b0C) HOWI \nbreathing either normobaric normoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.21) or normobaric \nhypoxia ([Formula: see text] = 0.14). Free and total thyroxine (T3) and \ntriiodothyronine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were \nmeasured in venous blood samples obtained before (baseline), during (15-, 30-, \nand 60 min), and 15 min following HOWI (post-), and were corrected for changes \nin plasma volume. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and core (rectal) \ntemperature were measured continuously. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was \nlower during hypoxia (90\u2009\u00b1\u20093%) compared with normoxia (98\u2009\u00b1\u20091%, P < 0.001). Core \ntemperature fell from baseline (normoxia: 37.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u00b0C, hypoxia: 37.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u00b0C) \nto post-cold HOWI (normoxia: 36.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C, hypoxia: 36.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C, P < 0.001) in \nboth conditions but did not change differently between conditions (condition \u00d7 \ntime: P = 0.552). Circulating TSH, total T3, free T4, total T3, and free T4 \nconcentrations demonstrated significant main effects of time (all P \u2264 0.024), \nbut these changes did not differ between normoxic and hypoxic conditions \n(condition \u00d7 time: all P \u2265 0.163). These data indicate that acute moderate \nnormobaric hypoxia does not modify the circulating thyroid hormone response \nduring 1 h of cold HOWI.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Acute head-out cold (22\u00b0C) water \nimmersion (HOWI) decreased core temperature and increased thermogenesis. This \nthermogenic response was paralleled by the activation of the \nhypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, as evidenced by changes in thyroid \nhormones. However, cold HOWI in combination with moderate normobaric hypoxia did \nnot modify the thermogenic nor the circulating thyroid hormone response. This \nfinding suggests that hypoxia-induced alterations in thyroid hormone \nconcentrations are unlikely to acutely contribute to adaptations resulting from \nrepeated cold-water exposures.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.00061.2024\nPMCID: PMC11365550\nPMID: 38660723 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No conflicts of interest, financial or \notherwise, are declared by the authors.",

The effects of repeated \npost-resistance exercise water immersion on inflammatory and hormone responses \nin athletes were investigated.\nMETHODS: Male, academy Super Rugby players (n\u2009=\u200918, 19.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5 y, 1.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u00a0m, \n98.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.7\u00a0kg) participated in a 12-week programme divided into 3 \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0 4-week \nblocks of post-resistance exercise water immersion (either, no immersion control \n[CON]; cold [CWI]; or hot [HWI] water immersion), utilising a randomised \ncross-over pre-post design. Fasted, morning blood measures were collected prior \nto commencement of first intervention block, and every fourth week thereafter. \nLinear mixed-effects models were used to analyse main (treatment, time) and \ninteraction effects.\nRESULTS: Repeated CWI (p\u2009=\u20090.025, g\u2009=\u20090.05) and HWI (p\u2009<\u20090.001, g\u2009=\u20090.62) \nreduced creatine kinase (CK), compared to CON. HWI decreased (p\u2009=\u20090.013, \ng\u2009=\u20090.59) interleukin (IL)-1ra, compared to CON. HWI increased (p\u2009<\u20090.001-0.026, \ng\u2009=\u20090.06-0.17) growth factors (PDGF-BB, IGF-1), compared to CON and CWI. CWI \nincreased (p\u2009=\u20090.004, g\u2009=\u20090.46) heat shock protein-72 (HSP-72), compared to HWI.\nCONCLUSION: Post-resistance exercise CWI or HWI resulted in trivial and moderate \nreductions in CK, respectively, which may be partly due to hydrostatic effects \nof water immersion. Post-resistance exercise HWI moderately decreased IL-1ra, \nwhich may be associated with post-resistance exercise skeletal muscle \ninflammation influencing chronic resistance exercise adaptive responses. \nFollowing post-resistance exercise water immersion, CWI increased HSP-72 \nsuggesting a thermoregulatory response indicating improved adaptive inflammatory \nresponses to temperature changes, while HWI increased growth factors (PDGF-BB, \nIGF-1) indicating different systematic signalling pathway activation.

The interventions were \nperformed in a randomized order with a 1-week wash-out period. We tested \nathletes before and after each intervention week regarding swim (100\u00a0m freestyle \nsprints) and functional performance (flexibility, upper and lower body power, \nand shoulder proprioception). We monitored athlete's perceptions (well-being, \nheaviness, tiredness, discomfort and pain) during testing sessions using a \n5-item questionnaire.

The aim of this study was to measure heart rate variability \n(HRV) and cold water-induced vasodilation (CIVD) after puncturing two different \near points with the same afference but that should have opposite effects \naccording to TMP.\nMETHODS: Ten healthy subjects were investigated in this single-blinded crossover \nstudy over three sessions. In the first session, sympathetic activation was \nperformed via cold water immersion of the right hand, with recordings taken from \nmultiple fingers. HRV was assessed in the time domain (square root of the mean \nsquared differences of NN intervals (RMSSD)) and frequency domain (low (LF) and \nhigh frequencies (HF)). In the second and third sessions, the same skin \nimmersion test was performed, and mechanical stimulation was applied to the ear \nat two different points on the internal surface of the antitragus, one with \nalleged parasympathetic activity and the other with alleged sympathetic \nactivity. The stimulation was done with semipermanent needles.\nRESULTS: Stimulation of the point with alleged parasympathetic activity \nimmediately resulted in a significant decrease in RMSSD in 75% of the subjects \nand in LF in 50% of the subjects, while stimulation of the point with alleged \nsympathetic activity resulted in an increase in HF and RMSSD in 50% of the \nsubjects. Stimulation of these points did not affect the CIVD reflex. The 20\u00a0min \ncold water immersion induced an immediate decrease in LF and the LF\/HF ratio and \nan increase in HF. The skin temperature of the nonimmersed medius significantly \ndecreased when the contralateral hand was immersed, from 34.4\u00a0\u00b0C to 31.8\u00a0\u00b0C.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of two different ear points innervated by the same \nafferent nerves elicited different HRV responses, suggesting somatotopy and a \nvagal effect beyond vagal afferences.

Dietary flavanols \nincrease bioavailable nitric oxide, a proposed mediator of CIVD through active \nvasodilation and\/or withdrawal of sympathetic vascular smooth muscle tone. \nHowever, no studies have examined the effects of flavanol intake on extremity \nskin perfusion during cold exposure. We tested the hypothesis that acute and \n8-day flavanol supplementation would augment CIVD during single-digit cold water \nimmersion (CWI).\nMETHODS: Eleven healthy adults (24\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0years; 10\u00a0M\/1F) ingested cocoa flavanols \n(900\u00a0mg\/day) or caffeine- and theobromine-matched placebo for 8\u00a0days in a \ndouble-blind, randomized, crossover design. On Days 1 and 8, CIVD was assessed \n2\u00a0h post-treatment. Subjects immersed their 3rd finger in warm water (42\u00a0\u00b0C) for \n15\u00a0min before CWI (4\u00a0\u00b0C) for 30\u00a0min, during which nail bed and finger pad skin \ntemperature were measured.\nRESULTS: Flavanol ingestion had no effect on CIVD frequency (Day 1, Flavanol: \n3\u2009\u00b1\u20092 vs. Placebo: 3\u2009\u00b1\u20092; Day 8, Flavanol: 3\u2009\u00b1\u20092 vs. Placebo: 3\u2009\u00b1\u20091) or \namplitude (Day 1, Flavanol: 4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vs. Placebo: 4.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\u00a0\u00b0C; Day 8, \nFlavanol: 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9 vs. Placebo: 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0\u00b0C) in the finger pad following acute \nor 8-day supplementation (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Furthermore, average, nadir, and apex \nfinger pad temperatures during CWI were not different between treatments on Days \n1 or 8 of supplementation (P\u2009>\u20090.05).

A field-expedient \nalternative may be tarp-assisted cooling, requiring only water and a tarp. The \nobjective of this study was to compare core temperature (Tc) cooling rates of \ntarp-assisted cooling using the limited resources available to a wildland \nfirefighter and the current standard care provided in wilderness settings.\nMETHODS: This cross-over, randomized control trial of 17 healthy individuals \nconsisted of exercise in a 42\u00b11\u00b0C, 32\u00b14% relative humidity environment while \nwearing wildland firefighter attire, followed by cooling. Body cooling consisted \nof either pouring 11 L of 25\u00b11\u00b0C water over the torso while lying supine on a \ntarp configured to hold water close to the individual (Tarp) or dousing the \nwater on the participant followed by lying supine with a light breeze, current \nstandard care in the wilderness (Current Care). Cooling occurred until Tc \nreached 38\u00b0C.\nRESULTS: Participants walked until a similar Tc was achieved in Tarp \n(39.59\u00b10.04\u00b0C) and Current Care (39.55\u00b10.22\u00b0C; P=0.36). Core temperature cooling \nrate was not different between Tarp (0.076\u00b10.042\u00b0C\u00b7min-1) and Current Care \n(0.088\u00b10.046\u00b0C\u00b7min-1; P=0.41).\nCONCLUSIONS: In hyperthermic individuals, Tarp did not provide a faster cooling \nrate compared to the current exertional heat stroke care provided in the \nwilderness, and both provided a slower cooling rate than that provided by the \ntraditional method of cold water immersion (>0.20\u00b0C\u00b7min-1) to treat exertional \nheat stroke patients.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Wilderness Medical Society.

Twelve national-team skaters (7 males, \n5 females) completed three trials according to a randomized cross-over study. \nFifteen minutes after an exhaustive ice-skating training session, participants \nunderwent 20\u2009min of HWI (41.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u00b0C), 15\u2009min of CWI (12.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u00b0C) or 15\u2009min \nof active recovery (AR).

The \nliterature has reported the beneficial effects of these agents on various pain \ndimensions in non-clinical populations.\nAIMS: To evaluate the potential analgesic effects of nature-based multisensory \nstimulation in women with fibromyalgia syndrome.\nMETHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial \nwith a 1:1 allocation ratio was conducted. Forty-two women with fibromyalgia \nsyndrome interacted with either different plant species with flowers, stones, \nand soil organic matter or their synthetic imitations for 30 minutes. Outcome \nmeasurements were performed before and after the intervention, including \nclinical pain intensity using the Numeric Rating Scale, cold pain thresholds \nusing the Cold Pressor Test, mechanical hyperalgesia and wind-up using a \nmonofilament, and pressure pain thresholds using a pressure algometer.\nRESULTS: Analyses revealed group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interactions for clinical pain intensity \n(F\u00a0=\u00a07.915, p\u00a0=\u00a0.008), cold-water immersion time (F\u00a0=\u00a07.271, p\u00a0=\u00a0.010), \nmechanical hyperalgesia (F\u00a0=\u00a04.701, p\u00a0=\u00a0.036), and pressure pain threshold (p \u2264 \n.017). Between-group differences were found in clinical pain intensity \n(p\u00a0=\u00a0.012), cold pain thresholds (p\u00a0=\u00a0.002), and pressure pain thresholds (p < \n.05). The experimental group exhibited reduced clinical pain intensity \n(p\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and increased pressure pain thresholds (p \u2264 .034).\nCONCLUSIONS: Women with fibromyalgia syndrome may benefit from multisensory \nstimulation using biotic and abiotic agents from natural environments for 30 \nminutes. Interacting with flowering plants and soil components appears to induce \nanalgesic effects.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Before the exercise sessions were performed, countermovement jump (CMJ) \nand heart rate variability were recorded (i.e., rMSSD, low and high frequency \npower and its ratio, SD1 and SD2). Exercise heart rate was calculated by \nrecording the area under the curve (AUC) response. Internal session load was \nevaluated 30 min after each session. Blood concentrations of creatine kinase and \nlactate dehydrogenase were analyzed before the first visit and 24 h after the \nlast sessions.\nRESULTS: The CWI group presented higher rMSSD than the control group at each \ntime point (group-effect P\u2009=\u20090.037). The SD1 was higher in CWI group when \ncompared to the control group following the last exercise session (interaction \nP\u2009=\u20090.038). SD2 was higher in CWI group compared to the control group at each \ntime point (group-effect P\u2009=\u20090.030). Both groups presented equal CMJ performance \n(P\u2009>\u20090.05), internal load (group-effect P\u2009=\u20090.702; interaction P\u2009=\u20090.062), heart \nrate AUC (group-effect P\u2009=\u20090.169; interaction P\u2009=\u20090.663), and creatine kinase \nand lactate dehydrogenase blood concentrations (P\u2009>\u20090.05).\nCONCLUSION: Repeated post-exercise CWI improves cardiac-autonomic modulation. \nHowever, no differences in neuromuscular performance, muscle damage markers, or \nsession internal load were demonstrated between the groups.\n\n\u00a9 2023.

No able-bodied \nparticipants revealed CIVDs in cool and thermoneutral conditions, while four \nrevealed CIVDs in hot conditions. The toe CIVDs of paraplegic participants were \ncounterintuitive in several respects: they were more frequent in cool and \nthermoneutral conditions (compared to the able-bodied participants), emerged in \nthese conditions despite lower core and skin temperatures of these participants, \nand were evident only in cases of thoracic level lesions (instead of lesions at \nlower spinal levels).\nCONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated considerable inter-individual variability \nin CIVD responses in both the paraplegic and able-bodied groups. While we \nobserved vasodilatory responses in the toes of participants with paraplegia that \ntechnically fulfilled the criteria for CIVD, it is unlikely that they reflect \nthe CIVD phenomenon observed in able-bodied individuals.

Following standardized training (5,383 m covered, \n350-m high-speed running, 28 repeated high-intensity efforts, 24 collisions), \nplayers completed a multimodal recovery (REC) strategy (i.e., \u223c640 kcal meal + \n\u223c1,285 kcal snacks or drinks, cold-water immersion, sleep hygiene \nrecommendations) or control (i.e., \u223c640 kcal meal: CONT) practices. Isometric \nmid-thigh pulls (IMTP), countermovement jumps (CMJ), and wellness questionnaires \nwere completed before (-3 hours) and after (+24, +48 hours) training. The \nrecovery strategy influenced IMTP peak force ( p = 0.026), but between-trial \ndifferences were undetectable. No other between-trial effects (all p > 0.05) \nwere seen for IMTP, CMJ, or wellness variables. Training-induced reductions in \nCMJ peak power (-4 \u00b1 6% vs baseline: 4,878 \u00b1 642 W) at +24 hours ( p = 0.016) \ndissipated by +48 hours.

Virtual reality \n(VR) may be an efficient pain management tool although the effectiveness in \nfibromyalgia patients is unclear. Objective: This randomized crossover study set \nout to 1) investigate the effect of VR on cold pain threshold, -tolerance, and \n-intensity in fibromyalgia patients and in pain-free individuals and 2) explore \nthe potential relationships between the effect of VR and pain catastrophizing. \nMaterials and Methods: Twenty-two female fibromyalgia patients and 22 sex- and \nage-matched pain-free individuals participated in two conditions (one with VR \nand one without VR) with foot immersion in 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C cold water. The order of \nconditions was randomized and counterbalanced for each group. Conditions were \nseparated by 20 minutes. Cold pain threshold, -tolerance, and -intensity were \nassessed during the conditions. Pain catastrophizing was assessed using the Pain \nCatastrophizing Scale. Results: VR induced moderate to large increases in cold \npain threshold and pain tolerance compared with the control condition for both \nthe fibromyalgia group and pain-free individuals (P\u2009<\u20090.03). Pain intensity was \nreduced after VR only in pain-free individuals (P\u2009<\u20090.003). Pain catastrophizing \nwas not related to VR effect on pain threshold, -tolerance, or -intensity for \nany group. Conclusion: VR had a significant effect on pain threshold and \ntolerance in fibromyalgia patients and pain-free individuals, which supports its \nability to distract from pain. Future studies exploring the VR's potential as \npart of clinical pain management alone or in combination with other treatments \nare warranted.

No \nstudies have assessed acute PBC exposure on peripheral blood mononuclear cell \nmobilisation or compared these with cold water immersion (CWI), which may inform \nhow PBC impacts inflammatory processes. This trial examined the impact of a \nsingle PBC exposure on circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared \nto CWI or a control. 26 males were randomised into either PBC (3\u00a0min at -\u2009110 to \n-\u2009140\u00a0\u00b0C), CWI (3\u00a0min at 9\u00a0\u00b0C), or control (3\u00a0min at 24\u00a0\u00b0C), with blood samples, \nheart rate, and blood pressure taken before and after exposure. Cytometric \nanalysis determined that CD8+ T-cell populations were significantly elevated \nafter treatments, with PBC increasing CD8+ T cells to a greater degree than \neither CWI or CON. Natural killer cell counts were also elevated after PBC, with \nthe increase attributed specifically to the CD56loCD16+ cytotoxic subset. This \nprovides the first evidence for the effect of PBC exposure on redistribution of \nimmune cells. An increase in circulating leukocyte subsets such as CD8+ T cells \nand CD56loCD16+ natural killer cells suggests that PBC may induce a transient \nmobilisation of lymphocytes. PBC may thus enable a more efficient trafficking of \nthese cells from the circulation to the site of initial cellular insult from \nexercise, potentially accelerating the process of cellular recovery. This \nprovides novel evidence on the use of PBC as a recovery treatment and may also \nhave applicability in other clinical settings involving the recovery of damaged \nskeletal muscle.\n\n\u00a9 2022.

This study investigated the effect \nof BR ingestion on cold induced vasodilation (CIVD) and rewarming of finger skin \ntemperature (Tfing) during and after hand immersion in cold water.\nMETHODS: Twenty healthy males (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD; age 22.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 years, height \n172.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0\u00a0cm, body mass 61.3\u2009\u00b1\u200911.7\u00a0kg) repeated a hand cold water immersion \ntest twice with prior BR or water beverage ingestion (randomised order). They \nrested for 2\u00a0h in thermoneutral conditions (27\u00a0\u00b0C, 40% relative humidity) after \nconsuming the beverage, then immersed their non-dominant hand in 8\u00a0\u00b0C water for \n30\u00a0min. They then rewarmed their hand in the ambient air for 20\u00a0min. Skin \ntemperature at seven body sites, Tfing, finger skin blood flow (SkBFfing), and \nblood pressure were measured.\nRESULTS: During hand immersion parameters of CIVD (Tfing and SkBFfing) were not \ndifferent between BR and water conditions although skin temperature gradient \nfrom proximal to distal body sites was significantly smaller with BR (P\u2009<\u20090.05). \nDuring rewarming, SkBFfing and cutaneous vascular conductance were significantly \nhigher with BR than with water (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The rewarming speed in Tfing and \nSkBFfing was significantly faster with BR at 15- (BR 1.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22 vs water \n1.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26\u00a0\u00b0C\/min) and 20-min rewarming (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally, individuals \nwith slower rewarming speed with water demonstrated accelerated rewarming with \nBR supplementation.\nCONCLUSION: BR accelerated rewarming in Tfing and SkBFfing after local cold \nstimulus, whereas, CIVD response during hand cold immersion was not affected by \nBR ingestion.\n\n\u00a9 2022.

Electronic address: P.Drummond@murdoch.edu.au.\n\nTo investigate links between blood glucose, body fat mass and pain, the effects \nof acute hyperglycaemia on pain sensitivity and pain inhibition were examined in \nhealthy adults with normal (n\u00a0=\u00a024) or excess body fat (n\u00a0=\u00a020) determined by \ndual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Effects of hyperglycaemia on heart rate \nvariability and reactive hyperaemia were also explored. For the overall sample, \ningesting 75-g glucose enhanced pain sensitivity during 1-minute cold-water \nimmersion of both feet (conditioning stimulus) and weakened the pain inhibitory \neffect of cold water on pressure pain thresholds (test stimulus). Exploratory \nsubgroup analyses not adjusted for multiple comparisons suggested that this \neffect was limited to people with excess fat mass. In addition, acute \nhyperglycaemia suppressed resting heart rate variability only in people with \nexcess fat mass. Furthermore, regardless of blood glucose levels, people with \nexcess fat mass had weaker pain inhibition for pinprick after cold water and \nreported more pain during 5-minutes of static blood flow occlusion. Neither high \nblood glucose nor excess body fat affected pinprick-temporal summation of pain \nor reactive hyperaemia. Together, these findings suggest that hyperglycaemia and \nexcess fat mass interfere with pain processing and autonomic function. \nPERSPECTIVE: Ingesting 75-g glucose (equivalent to approximately 2 standard cans \nof soft drink) interfered with pain-processing and autonomic function, \nparticularly in people with excess body fat mass. As both hyperglycaemia and \noverweight are risk factors for diabetes, whether these are sources of pain in \npeople with diabetes should be further explored.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 United States Association for the Study of Pain, Inc.

Sea accidents have become an urgent humanitarian crisis due to the high \nnumber of migrants on the move, but data on the physiological effects to sudden \ncool water immersion are not as extensive as cold-water studies. We wanted to \nevaluate to what extent cool water immersion (~18 \u00b0C) may detrimentally affect \ncognitive ability and cardiorespiratory strain compared to the more prevalent \ncold-water (<10-15 \u00b0C) studies.\nMETHODS: In this case, 10 active, healthy men participated in this study which \nconsisted of completing one familiarization trial, and then a control (CON) or \nexperimental (EXP) trial in a randomized, repeated-measures, cross-over fashion, \nseparated by at least 7-days. Cognitive function was assessed via the Symbol \nDigit Modalities Test (SDMT), a code substitution test, performed at baseline, \nthen repeated in either a thermoneutral (~25 \u00b0C room air) dry environment, or \nwhen immersed to the neck in 18 \u00b0C water. Testing consisted of six \"Step\" \ntime-blocks 45-s each, with a 5-s pause between each Step. Cardiorespiratory \nmeasures, continuously recorded, included heart rate (beats per minute), minute \nventilation (V\u02d9E, L\u2219min-1), oxygen consumption (V\u02d9O2, L\u2219min-1), and respiratory \nfrequency (fR, count\u2219min-1).\nRESULTS: Initial responses to cool water (<2 min) found that participants \nperformed ~11% worse on the code substitution test (p = 0.025), consumed 149% \ngreater amounts of oxygen (CI: 5.1 to 9.1 L\u2219min-1, p < 0.0001) and experienced \nhigher cardiovascular strain (HR CI: 13 to 38 beats per minute, p = 0.001) than \nduring the control trial. Physiological strain was in-line to those observed in \nmuch colder water temperature.\nCONCLUSION: Sudden, cool water immersion also negatively affects cognitive \nfunction and cardiorespiratory strain, especially during the first two minutes \nof exposure. The magnitude increase in heart rate is strongly associated with \npoorer cognitive function, even in (relatively) warmer water consistent with \ntemperatures found in the Mediterranean Sea environment.\n\nDOI: 10.3390\/ijerph19031601\nPMCID: PMC8834950\nPMID: 35162622 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors confirm they have no conflict of \ninterests to declare.",

Pain impacts physical activities, joint mobility, \nstress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Cold-water immersion therapy \nreduces inflammation and pain associated with gout arthritis. However, \ncold-water immersion therapy has not been conducted among people worldwide with \ngout arthritis. Objective: To investigate the cold-water immersion intervention \non pain, joint mobility, physical activity, stress, anxiety, depression, and \nquality of life among acute gout patients. Methods: A community-based randomized \ncontrol trial design with two parallel-intervention groups: a cold-water \nimmersion group (20-30\u00b0C 20\u00a0minutes\/day for 4\u00a0weeks) and a control group. In \ntotal, 76 eligible participants in Tomohon City, Indonesia, were recruited using \na multi-stage sampling method and were randomly assigned using block \nrandomization. A generalized estimating equation model was used to analyze the \nresults (coef. \u03b2) and produce 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A path analysis \nwas used to analyze mediating effects. Results: Significant pain alleviation (\u03b2 \n= -2.06; -2.42), improved joint mobility (\u03b2 = 1.20, 1.44), physical activity (\u03b2 \n= 2.05, .59), stress (\u03b2 = -1.25; -1.35), anxiety (\u03b2 = -.62; -1.37), and quality \nof life (\u03b2 = 5.34; 9.93) were detected after cold-water immersion at the \nsecond-week, and were maintained to the fourth-week time point, compared to \npre-intervention and the control group. Depression (\u03b2 = -1.80) had decreased by \nthe fourth week compared to the pre-test and control group. Cold-water immersion \ndirectly mediated alleviation of pain (\u03b2 = -.46, p \u2264 .001) and to promote the \nquality of life (\u03b2 = .16, p = .01). Conclusions: Cold-water immersion decreased \npain, stress, anxiety, and depression, and increased joint mobility, physical \nactivity, and quality of life. It mediated alleviation of pain to increase the \nquality of life.\n\nDOI: 10.1177\/10998004211063547\nPMID: 35021915 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We conducted a randomised cross-over study involving 28 \nhealthy active men where muscle contractile properties of the VM wer recorded \nusing Tensiomyography (TMG) before and after CWI, HWI or passive resting and up \nto one-hour post-application. The main outcomes obtained were muscle \ndisplacement and velocity of deformation according to limb size (Dmr and Vdr). \nOur results showed a significant effect of time (F(3.9,405)\u00a0=32.439; p <0.001; \n\u03b72p\u00a0=0.29) and the interaction between time and temperature (F(7.9,405)\u00a0=5.814; \np <0.001; \u03b72p=0.13) on Dmr but no for temperature alone (F(2,81)\u00a0=2.013; p \n=0.14; \u03b72p=0.04) while for Vdr, both time (F(5.2,486)\u00a0=23.068; p <0.001 \n\u03b72p\u00a0=\u00a00.22) and temperature (F(2,81)\u00a0=4.219; p =\u00a00.018; \u03b72p=\u00a00.09) as well as \nthe interaction (F(10.4,486)\u00a0=7.784; p <0.001; \u03b72p\u00a0=0.16) were found \nsignificant.

Notably, \nit is unknown if low-dose fentanyl influences human autonomic cardiovascular \nresponses during painful stimuli in humans. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis \nthat low-dose fentanyl reduces perceived pain and subsequent sympathetic and \ncardiovascular responses in humans during an experimental noxious stimulus. \nTwenty-three adults (10 females\/13 males; 27\u2009\u00b1\u20097 yr; 26\u2009\u00b1\u20093 kg\u00b7m-2, means \u00b1 SD) \ncompleted this randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial during two \nlaboratory visits. During each visit, participants completed a cold pressor test \n(CPT; hand in \u223c0.4\u00b0C ice bath for 2 min) before and 5 min after drug\/placebo \nadministration (75 \u03bcg fentanyl or saline). We compared pain perception (100-mm \nvisual analog scale), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; microneurography, \n11 paired recordings), and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP; \nphotoplethysmography) between trials (at both pre- and postdrug\/placebo \ntimepoints) using paired, two-tailed t tests. Before drug\/placebo \nadministration, perceived pain (P = 0.8287), \u0394MSNA burst frequency (P = 0.7587), \nand \u0394mean BP (P = 0.8649) during the CPT were not different between trials. \nAfter the drug\/placebo administration, fentanyl attenuated perceived pain (36 \nvs. 66 mm, P < 0.0001), \u0394MSNA burst frequency (9 vs. 17 bursts\/min, P = 0.0054), \nand \u0394mean BP (7 vs. 13 mmHg, P = 0.0174) during the CPT compared with placebo. \nFentanyl-induced reductions in pain perception and \u0394mean BP were moderately \nrelated (r = 0.40, P = 0.0641).

Warmth perception of the feet \n(Herdecke Warmth Perception Questionnaire, HeWEF) at the follow-up (10\u2009minutes \nafter completion of footbaths, t2) was assessed as the primary outcome measure. \nSecondary outcome measures included overall warmth as well as self-reported \nwarmth (HeWEF) and measured skin temperature (high resolution thermography) of \nthe face, hands and feet at baseline (t0), post immersion (t1), and follow-up \n(t2).\nRESULTS: With respect to the warmth perception of the feet, GI and MU differed \nsignificantly from WA (P's\u2009<\u2009.05) with the highest effect sizes at t1 (WA vs GI, \nd\u2009=\u20090.92, WA vs MU, d\u2009=\u20090.73). At t2, perceived warmth tended to be higher with \nGI compared to WA (d\u2009=\u20090.46). No differences were detected between ON and HC for \nself-reported warmth. With respect to skin temperatures, face and feet skin \ntemperatures of ON were colder (at t0 and t1, 0.42\u2009\u2265\u2009d\u2009\u2265\u20090.68) and tended to \nhave diametrical response patterns than HC (ON vs HC: colder vs warmer after \nMU).\nCONCLUSION: Among adult oncological patients and healthy controls, footbaths \nwith mustard and ginger increased warmth perception of the feet longer than with \nwarm water only. The potential impact of regularly administered thermogenic \nfootbaths over extended periods merits further investigation for the recovery of \ncancer-related sense of cold.\n\nDOI: 10.1177\/15347354211058449\nPMCID: PMC8647243\nPMID: 34814768 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The \nauthor(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the \nresearch, authorship, and\/or publication of this article.",

Interventions \ntwice daily were oxycodone (10\u00a0mg), tapentadol (50\u00a0mg) and placebo for 14\u00a0days. \nTonic pain was induced on day 1, 4 and 14 by immersing the hand in 2\u00a0\u00b0C water \nfor 120\u00a0s. Electroencephalography was recorded during test pain at baseline and \nafter 14\u00a0days. Spectral analysis and source localization were investigated in \npredefined frequency bands.\nRESULTS: A decreased perception of pain on day 4 persisted throughout the \n14\u00a0days compared to baseline (p\u00a0<\u00a00.006). Oxycodone decreased the \nelectroencephalography spectral power in the delta and theta bands and increased \npower in the alpha1, alpha2 and beta1 bands (p\u00a0<\u00a00.03). Tapentadol increased \nspectral power in the alpha1 band (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Source localization revealed that \noxycodone decreased activity of the temporal and limbic region in the delta \nband, and frontal lobe in the alpha2 and beta1 bands, whereas tapentadol \ndecreased alpha1 band activity in the temporal lobe compared to placebo.\nCONCLUSION: Oxycodone and tapentadol reduced pain perception and changed the \ncentral processing of tonic pain.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Different mechanisms of action were involved, where oxycodone \naffected cortical structures more than tapentadol.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In each trial, \nparticipants completed a 45-min preload exercise (50% V\u0307O2peak), followed by a \n15-min TT. Physiological (rectal [Tre], skin [Tsk], and neck [Tneck] \ntemperature, and heart rate [HR]) and perceptual data (ratings of perceived \nexertion [RPE], thermal comfort [TC] and thermal sensation [TS]) were measured \nthroughout.\nRESULTS: Tre and Tsk were lower in PRE and PRE\u202f+\u202fPER at the start of the preload \n(p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Tre remained lower throughout the preload following CWI although \nthese differences were no longer present at the start of the TT (p\u202f=\u202f0.22). \nTneck was lowered throughout in PER and PRE\u202f+\u202fPER (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). No other \nphysiological or perceptual differences were observed at the start or end of the \npreload or TT. Participants covered a similar TT distance in all trials \n(15.7-15.9\u202fkm, p\u202f=\u202f0.77).\nCONCLUSIONS: Pre-cooling induced thermoregulatory benefits for ~45\u202fmin and \nperceptual benefits for the same duration when supplemented with per-cooling. \nNeck per-cooling offered no such benefits when used in isolation. Neither pre- \nnor per-cooling, in isolation or combination, improved subsequent 15-min cycling \ntime-trial performance in well-trained participants in the heat (40\u202f\u00b0C).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Sports Medicine Australia.

However, several factors such as \nshocking induced by cold water can affect the effectiveness of this technique.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 4 weeks cold water \nhabituation on the effectiveness of CWI recovery technique on muscle damage and \nfunction indices of young soccer players.\nMETHODS: Twenty young men with no previous experience of CWI participated in \nthis study. Output power and RSADec of subjects were measured. The subjects then \nperformed a simulated soccer test and, after collecting blood samples, were \nimmediately immersed in 15 \u00b0 C water for 15 minutes. Twenty-four hours later \nblood sampling and functional tests were repeated. Subjects then were divided \nrandomly into two groups of exercise with CWI recovery and exercise with passive \nrecovery. After four weeks, the blood sampling and performance tests repeated \nlike the pre-test.\nRESULTS: The CWI had no significant effect on serum levels of AST and LDH before \nand after 4 weeks of CWI (P> 0.05). Also, there was no significant difference in \npower output and RSADec after CWI before and after cold water habituation (P> \n0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: It seems that the experience of recovering by immersion in \ncold-water has no effect on the effectiveness of this method. Therefore, soccer \ncoaches and athletes should think more about using this recovery method.\n\nINTRODUCTION : l'immersion en eau froide est l'une des techniques de \nr\u00e9cup\u00e9ration et de r\u00e9\u00e9ducation les plus courantes chez les athl\u00e8tes.

A low body (cell) temperature or \nthe increase in the concentrations of the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, \nand norepinephrine in response to acute cold stress have been proposed as potent \nproinflammatory cytokine suppressant. In the current study, we tested the \nhypothesis that the recovery of body temperature from a whole-body intermittent \ncold-water immersion (CWI, at 13-14\u00a0\u00b0C for a total 170\u00a0min) is associated with a \ndelayed response of proinflammatory cytokines in young healthy men. Our results \nrevealed a delay in the increase in the proinflammatory interleukin 6 and \ninterleukin 1\u03b2 cytokines after the CWI, which paralleled the changes in \ncortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and body temperature. CWI decreased tumor \nnecrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) immediately and 1\u00a0h after the CWI. Although TNF-\u03b1 had \nrecovered to the pre-immersion level at 2\u00a0h after CWI, its natural circadian \ncycle kinetics was disrupted until 12\u00a0h after the CWI. Furthermore, we showed \nthat CWI strongly modified the white blood cell counts, with changes reaching a \npeak between 1 and 2\u00a0h after the CWI.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

CIVD is thought to occur \nthrough active vasodilation and\/or sympathetic withdrawal, where nitric oxide \n(NO) may play a key role in mediating these mechanisms. Beetroot juice (BRJ) is \nhigh in dietary nitrate (NO3-) which undergoes sequential reduction to nitrite \n(NO2-) and subsequently NO. Using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design, \nwe examined the effect of acute BRJ supplementation on the CIVD response in 10 \nhealthy males.\nMETHODS: Participants had a resting blood pressure measurement taken prior to \ningesting 140\u00a0mL of nitrate-rich BRJ (13\u00a0mmol NO3-) or a NO3--free placebo \n(PLA). After 2\u00a0h, participants immersed their hand in neutral water (~\u200935\u00a0\u00b0C) \nfor 10\u00a0min of baseline before cold water immersion (~\u20098\u00a0\u00b0C) for 30\u00a0min. \nLaser-Doppler fluxmetry and skin temperature were measured continuously on the \ndigits.\nRESULTS: Compared to PLA (100\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0mmHg), acute BRJ supplementation significantly \nreduced mean arterial pressure at -30\u00a0min (96\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0mmHg; p\u2009=\u20090.007) and 0\u00a0min \n(94\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0mmHg; p\u2009=\u20090.008). Acute BRJ supplementation had no effect on \nLaser-Doppler fluxmetry during CIVD (expressed as cutaneous vascular \nconductance) measured as area under the curve (BRJ: 843\u2009\u00b1\u2009148 PU\u00a0mmHg-1\u00a0s; PLA: \n1086\u2009\u00b1\u2009333 PU\u00a0mmHg-1\u00a0s), amplitude (BRJ: 0.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 PU\u00a0mmHg-1; PLA: 0.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14 \nPU\u00a0mmHg-1), and duration (BRJ: 895\u2009\u00b1\u200960\u00a0s; PLA: 894\u2009\u00b1\u200946\u00a0s).\nCONCLUSION: Acute BRJ supplementation does not augment the CIVD response in \nhealthy males.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-021-04621-8\nPMID: 33620545 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

CWI had no effect on these markers. Numbers of the most \nabundant circulating cell type, neutrophils, were elevated at POST more so in \nCWI (p < 0.05, vs. CON).

There was an interaction (F = 3.592; P = .015) \nand a time effect (F = 122.631; P = .0001) for blood lactate concentration, \nshowing lower levels after CWI versus CG (P = .028; ES = 0.93, moderate) and \nafter CWI versus SS (P = .042; ES = 0.82, moderate). There was an interaction (F \n= 9.617; P = .001) for handgrip strength, showing an impairment in performance \nafter SS (P = .001; ES = 0.67, moderate).\nCONCLUSION: CWI promoted restoration of muscle strength and endurance and \nreduction in blood lactate levels after the simulated fight and can thus be used \nby jiu-jitsu athletes as a recovery strategy between fights.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2019-0701\nPMID: 33477108 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Recently, however, indications have emerged suggesting \nthat the regular use of cold-water immersion might be detrimental to strength \ntraining adaptation.\nMETHODS: In a randomized crossover design, 11 participants performed two 8-week \ntraining periods including 3 leg training sessions per week, separated by an \n8-week \"wash out\" period. After each session, participants performed 10 minutes \nof either whole-body cold-water immersion (cooling) or passive sitting \n(control). Leg press 1-repetition maximum and countermovement jump performance \nwere determined before (pre), after (post) and 3 weeks after (follow-up) both \ntraining periods. Before and after training periods, leg circumference and \nmuscle thickness (vastus medialis) were measured.\nRESULTS: No significant effects were found for strength or jump performance. \nComparing training adaptations (pre vs post), small and negligible negative \neffects of cooling were found for 1-repetition maximum (g = 0.42; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.42 to 1.26) and countermovement jump (g = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.82 \nto 0.86). Comparing pre versus follow-up, moderate negative effects of cooling \nwere found for 1-repetition maximum (g = 0.71; 95% CI, -0.30 to 1.72) and \ncountermovement jump (g = 0.64; 95% CI, -0.36 to 1.64). A significant condition \n\u00d7 time effect (P = .01, F = 10.00) and a large negative effect of cooling (g = \n1.20; 95% CI, -0.65 to 1.20) were observed for muscle thickness.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present investigation suggests small negative effects of \nregular cooling on strength training adaptations.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2019-0965\nPMID: 33217726 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Seventy-eight older men and \nwomen performed a single bout of strength training on the calf muscles (3 \nexercises with 4 sets of 10 reps with 75% of 1RM) to induce muscle damage. After \nthe damaging exercise, participants received either a 15-minute massage on calf \nmuscles, or a CWI of the lower limb in cold water (15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00b0C) for 15\u00a0minute, or \npassive rest.

Muscle pain, calf muscle strength, \njoint position sense, dynamic balance, postural sway, and fear of falling were \nmeasured at each time point. Repeated application of massage after EIMD relieved \nmuscle pain, attenuated the loss of muscle strength and joint position senses, \nreduce balance impairments, and fear of falling in older adults (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.05). \nHowever, repeated applications of CWI, despite relieving muscle pain (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.05), \ndid not attenuate the loss of muscle strength, joint position senses, balance \nimpairments, and fear of falling. CWI had only some modest effects on muscle \npain, but massage attenuated EIMD symptoms and the related impairments in muscle \nstrength, joint position sense, balance, and postural sway in untrained older \nindividuals. Therefore, older exercisers who plan to participate in strength \ntraining can benefit from massage for recovery from muscle damage indices and \nbalance to decrease falling risk during the days following strength training.\n\n\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons A\/S.

The study aimed to examine if a portable cooling vest meets the \nestablished cooling criteria (0.15 \u00b0C\u00b7min-1 or greater) for EHS treatment. It \nwas hypothesized that a cooling vest will not meet the established cooling \ncriteria for EHS treatment. Materials and Methods: Fourteen recreationally \nactive participants (mean \u00b1 SD; male, n = 8; age, 25 \u00b1 4 years; body mass, 86.7 \n\u00b1 10.5 kg; body fat, 16.5 \u00b1 5.2%; body surface area, 2.06 \u00b1 0.15 m2. female, n = \n6; 22 \u00b1 2 years; 61.3 \u00b1 6.7 kg; 22.8 \u00b1 4.4%; 1.66 \u00b1 0.11 m2) exercised on a \nmotorized treadmill in a hot climatic chamber (ambient temperature 39.8 \u00b1 1.9 \n\u00b0C, relative humidity 37.4 \u00b1 6.9%) until they reached rectal temperature (TRE) \n>39 \u00b0C (mean TRE, 39.59 \u00b1 0.38 \u00b0C). Following exercise, participants were cooled \nusing either a cooling vest (VEST) or passive rest (PASS) in the climatic \nchamber until TRE reached 38.25 \u00b0C. Trials were assigned using randomized, \ncounter-balanced crossover design. Results: There was a main effect of cooling \nmodality type on cooling rates (F[1, 24] = 10.46, p < 0.01, \u03b72p = 0.30), with a \ngreater cooling rate observed in VEST (0.06 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b0C\u00b7min-1) than PASS (0.04 \u00b1 \n0.01 \u00b0C\u00b7min-1) (MD = 0.02, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.03]). There were also main effects \nof sex (F[1, 24] = 5.97, p = 0.02, \u03b72p = 0.20) and cooling modality type (F[1, \n24] = 4.38, p = 0.047, \u03b72p = 0.15) on cooling duration, with a faster cooling \ntime in female (26.9 min) than male participants (42.2 min) (MD = 15.3 min, 95% \nCI = [2.4, 28.2]) and faster cooling duration in VEST than PASS (MD = 13.1 min, \n95% CI = [0.2, 26.0]). An increased body mass was associated with a decreased \ncooling rate in PASS (r = -0.580, p = 0.03); however, this association was not \nsignificant in vest (r = -0.252, p = 0.39). Conclusions: Although VEST exhibited \na greater cooling capacity than PASS, VEST was far below an acceptable cooling \nrate for EHS treatment.

Before and after beta-blocker \nintake, electrocardiograms were recorded as participants (1) were exposed to a \nloud noise of \u223c100 dB; and (2) had their face immersed into cold water.\nRESULTS: Twenty-three patients (9 LQTS1, 14 LQTS2) participated. In response to \nnoise, LQTS groups showed similarly increased heart rate, but LQTS2 patients had \ncorrected QT interval (Fridericia formula) (QTcF) prolonged significantly more \nthan LQTS1 patients (37 \u00b1 8 ms vs 15 \u00b1 6 ms; P = .02). After intake of \nbeta-blocker, QTcF prolongation in LQTS2 patients was significantly blunted and \nsimilar to that of LQTS1 patients (P = .90). In response to simulated diving, \nLQTS groups experienced a heart rate drop of \u223c28 bpm, which shortened QTcF \nsimilarly in both groups. After intake of beta-blockers, heart rate dropped to \n28 \u00b1 2 bpm in LQTS1 patients and 20 \u00b1 3 bpm in LQTS2, resulting in a slower \nheart rate in LQTS1 compared with LQTS2 (P = .01). In response, QTcF shortened \nsimilarly in LQTS1 and LQTS2 patients (57 \u00b1 9 ms vs 36 \u00b1 7 ms; P = .10).\nCONCLUSION: When exposed to noise, LQTS2 patients had QTc prolonged \nsignificantly more than did LQTS1 patients. Importantly, beta-blockers reduced \nnoise-induced QTc prolongation in LQTS2 patients, thus demonstrating the \nprotective effect of beta-blockers. In response to simulated diving, LQTS groups \nresponded similarly, but a slower heart rate was observed in LQTS1 patients \nduring simulated diving after beta-blocker intake.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Heart Rhythm Society.

In \nJapan, this phenomenon is called \"hie-sho\" and reduces quality of life for \nseveral people, particularly women. A previous study has shown that a \nstandardized oligomerized-polyphenol from Litchi chinensis fruit extract (OPLFE) \nreportedly causes a significant increase in body surface temperature. The \npresent study aimed to investigate whether supplementation with OPLFE affected \nperipheral circulation and cold sensitivity. This randomized, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled trial was performed including 25 participants (age, 45.0\u00b110.4 \ny; 3 males and 22 females) who were assigned to consume OPLFE, mixed plant \nextract with OPLFE, or placebo capsules for 14 d. Participants were instructed \nto relax for 60 min in a temperature-controlled room prior to obtaining \nmeasurements. Changes in skin temperature and peripheral blood flow of the \nmiddle finger were assessed immediately before and 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min \nafter immersion in cold water (10\u00baC). Participants' height, weight, skin \ntemperature, and blood flow in peripheral tissue were measured; furthermore, \ntheir \"hie-sho\" was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Skin \ntemperature and blood flow in peripheral tissue increased in the OPLFE and mixed \nplant extract with OPLFE groups on day 14 compared with those on day 1. In \naddition, cold sensitivity in these two groups significantly improved between \nday 1 and day 14. These findings suggest that OPLFE improves \"hie-sho\" by \nincreasing peripheral blood flow and skin temperature.\n\nDOI: 10.3177\/jnsv.66.255\nPMID: 32612088 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The aim of this study is to compare the \nimpacts of two methods of immersion of legs in cold and warm water on the RLS \nsymptoms among the pregnant women.\nMETHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 80 pregnant women with \nRLS who referred to Taleghani educational-therapy center. After obtaining their \ninformed consent, they were selected by accessible method and randomly allocated \ninto group 1 (warm water) and group 2 (cold water). Group 1 were asked to put \ntheir legs in cold water for 10\u2009min every night for 2 weeks. The group 2 put \ntheir legs in warm water under the same condition. The severity of RLS was \nmeasured before and after the study. Data analysis was conducted using \ndescriptive as well as the analytical statistics such as Chi-square, independent \nT test, pair T test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon and covariance.\nRESULTS: After intervention, mean RLS of the cold water group was11.02\u2009\u00b1\u20094.93; \nwhile this mean was 13.50\u2009\u00b1\u20094.74 in the warm water group. The difference between \nthe two groups was significant (p\u2009=\u20090.017). Results also revealed that the \nseverity of RLS symptoms at the end of the treatment was different from the \nbeginning of the research in both groups (p\u2009=\u20090.001). The intervention with both \nwarm and cold water declined the RLS symptoms among pregnant women.\nCONCLUSION: The warm and cold water can be used for this purpose depending on \nthe women's preference. However, this article recommends the cold water for more \nreducing of symptoms.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-eight females were allocated to PBC \n(30\u00a0seconds at -60\u00b0C, 2\u00a0minutes at -135\u00b0C), CWI (10\u00a0minutes at 10\u00b0C), or CON \n(10\u00a0minutes resting). Muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2 ), cutaneous vascular \nconductance (CVC), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and local skin temperature were \nassessed at baseline and through 60\u00a0minutes (10-minute intervals), while delayed \nonset of muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle swelling, maximum voluntary isometric \ncontraction (MVIC), and vertical jump performance (VJP) were assessed up to \n72\u00a0hours (24-hour intervals) following treatments. SmO2 was lower in PBC \n(\u0394-2.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.08%) and CWI (\u0394-5.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.80%) compared with CON (\u039418.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.46%) \nthroughout the 60-minute follow-up period (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). CVC was lower from PBC \n(92.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025.0%, 90.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.4%) and CWI (90.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.5%, 88.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.9%) compared with \nCON (119.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1 and 116.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6%, respectively) between 20 and 30\u00a0minutes \n(P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Mean skin temperature was lower from CWI vs PBC (between 10 and \n40\u00a0minutes, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Mean skin temperature was higher in CON compared with CWI \nup to 60\u00a0minutes and compared with PBC up to 30\u00a0minutes (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). DOMS was \nlower following both PBC and CWI compared with CON through 72-hour (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), \nwith no difference between groups. No main group differences for swelling, MVIC, \nand VJP were observed. In conclusion, CWI elicited generally greater \nphysiological effects compared with PBC while both interventions were more \neffective than CON in reducing DOMS in females, but had no effect on functional \nmeasures or swelling.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

There are several interventions available for exercise induced \nmuscle damage recovery, but cold-water immersion (CWI) stands out among them. \nThe effects of CWI are unclear in the literature and, although the number of \nstreet runners has been growing, there is a gap in the scientific evidence \nregarding the use of CWI to recover runners' performance after a 10-km street \nrun. Purpose: The goal of our study was to analyze the effects of CWI on the \nrecovery of muscle damage markers after a 10-km street run. Method: We randomly \nassigned thirty male recreational street runners, immediately after a 10-km \nstreet run, into three recovery groups: control (rest for 10 minutes), immersion \n(10 min immersed in water without ice at room temperature) and CWI (10 min \nimmersed in water with ice at 10\u00baC). We assessed pain, triple hop distance, \nextensor peak torque and blood creatine kinase levels pre- and post-run, \npost-intervention and 24 hours after the run. Results: The 10-km run was enough \nto decrease triple hop distance and extensor peak torque, and increase levels of \ncreatine kinase (p < 0.05); however, we found no time\/group interactions in any \nof the assessed variables after we applied the appropriate interventions (p > \n0.05). Conclusion: 10-min CWI at 10\u00b0C was no more effective than water immersion \nand rest in recovering muscle damage markers after 10-km runs.\n\nDOI: 10.1080\/02701367.2019.1659477\nPMID: 31652109 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

J Strength Cond Res \n33(8): 2233-2240, 2019-Post-exercise cooling, e.g., cold water immersion has \nshown beneficial cardiovascular and hormonal effects during recovery from \nexercise in a hot environment. However, not much is known about the effects of a \ncold water shower (CWS) as a recovery intervention. This study examined the \neffects of a CWS on heart rate (HR), core temperature (Tc), salivary cortisol, \nand thermal comfort sensation (TCS) after exercise in the heat. Nine healthy \nmale subjects (age, 21 \u00b1 1 year) performed 45 minutes of cycling in a hot \nenvironment (35\u00b0 C, 40-60% relative humidity) at 65% of peak oxygen uptake. \nThereafter, subjects underwent the CWS condition (15 minutes, 15\u00b0 C water \nshower) or control (SIT25; 15 minutes passive recovery in 25\u00b0 C room) in a \nrandomized crossover design. After each 15 minutes, subjects sat in a 25\u00b0 C room \nfor another 2-hour recovery. Heart rate, Tc, and TCS were recorded before and \nimmediately after exercise, immediately after CWS or SIT25, and at 30 minutes, \n1, and 2 hours during additional recovery. Salivary cortisol was collected at \nthe same time points except at 30 minutes of the additional recovery period. \nThermal comfort sensation was higher immediately after CWS (+4; very \ncomfortable) than SIT25 (+1; just comfortable). The change of HR decreased \nfaster with CWS (-18.3 \u00b1 2.3%) than with SIT25 (-7.0 \u00b1 4.6%) at the first \n30-minute recovery time point (p < 0.01). No differences between recovery \nconditions were observed for the Tc or salivary cortisol at any time point \nduring the 2-hour recovery period. The findings demonstrate that a 15-minute, \n15\u00b0 C CWS was not effective in reducing Tc or salivary cortisol during recovery \nfrom exercise in a hot environment. However, CWS can promote TCS by facilitating \na faster HR recovery after 30-minute postintervention compared with passive \nrecovery. The cooling benefits of a CWS could be only recommended to reduce \ncardiac stress after routine workout in a hot environment.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000003017\nPMID: 31343603 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, \nrecent reports have cautioned that CWI may attenuate the adaptive response to \nresistance training.\nPURPOSE: To determine the effect of post resistance-exercise CWI on circulating \nfree testosterone (T) and cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) response.\nMETHODS: Using a randomized and counterbalanced repeated-measures design, 11 \nresistance-trained men completed two workouts (6 sets of 10 repetitions of back \nsquats at 80% of maximum load) a week apart after which they took part in either \n15\u00a0min of CWI (15\u00a0\u00b0C) or passive recovery. T, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 were measured in \nblood samples taken before (PRE) and 5 (5POST), 15 (15POST), 30 (30POST), and 60 \n(60POST) min post-exercise and compared between treatments and over time.\nRESULTS: For T, a significant interaction effect of condition over time \n(p\u2009=\u20090.030) as well as greater relative concentrations of T in CON (\u03949.2%) than \nCWI (\u0394-0.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.049) at 30POST were observed. In addition, at 60POST, T \ndropped below PRE values in CWI (\u0394-10.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.028) but not in CON (\u0394-1.6%, \np\u2009=\u20090.850). A suppressed cytokine response was observed after CWI in IL-6 at \n30POST (CWI: \u03944.9%, CON: \u039447.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.041) and TNF\u03b1 at 15POST (CWI: \u03945.3%, CON: \n\u039417.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.022).\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI blunted the T and cytokine response after a bout of resistance \nexercise. These results indicate that CWI results in an altered anabolic \nresponse and may help to explain the previous observation of attenuated \nhypertrophy when CWI is used after resistance exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-019-04178-7\nPMID: 31222379 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Each \nparticipant performed a maximum-exertion exercise performance test on a bicycle, \nand heart rate was measured. Subsequently, six cycles of HIIE (1 minute at 120% \nheart rate reserve [HRR] and 4 minutes at 40% HRR) were performed in a random \nsequence, and the recovery period involved either CWI or static rest (SR).\nRESULTS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels at the 6th and 20th minute \nof CWI recovery were significantly higher than those during SR and significantly \nhigher than those during a quiet state at the 6th minute. The heart rates at the \n20th minute and 35th minute of CWI recovery were significantly lower than that \nduring SR, and the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) at the 6th and 20th \nminute of CWI recovery were significantly lower than that during SR. No \nsignificant difference in lactate production was evident between the two \nrecovery strategies. Ear temperature was not significantly different when it was \nquiet, at the end of exercise, and at the 6th and 35th minute of recovery; \nhowever, at the 20th minute of recovery, ear temperature during CWI was \nsignificantly higher than that during SR.\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI after HIIE reduced the extent to which blood pressure \ndecreased. For the fatigue-related heart rate and RPE indicators, CWI was \nsuperior to SR.\n\nDOI: 10.23736\/S0022-4707.19.09771-8\nPMID: 31219254 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In a randomized repeated-measures design, nine \nrecreationally active males completed an acute two-legged high-intensity cycling \nprotocol (8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min at 82.5% peak power output) followed by 10\u00a0min of two-legged \npost-exercise CWI (8\u00b0C) or control conditions (CON).

Very low muscle \nglycogen attenuated the increase in PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression compared with the LOW \nlimbs in both the control (CON VLOW ~3.6-fold vs. CON LOW ~5.6-fold: P\u00a0=\u00a00.023, \nES 1.22 Large) and CWI conditions (CWI VLOW ~2.4-fold vs. CWI LOW ~8.0 fold: \nP\u00a0=\u00a00.019, ES 1.43 Large). Furthermore, PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression in the CWI-LOW \ntrial was not significantly different to the CON LOW limb (P\u00a0=\u00a00.281, ES 0.67 \nModerate). Data demonstrate that the previously reported effects of \npost-exercise CWI on PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression (as regulated systemically via \n\u03b2-adrenergic mediated cell signaling) are offset in those conditions in which \nlocal stressors (i.e., high-intensity exercise and low muscle glycogen \navailability) have already sufficiently activated the AMPK-PGC-1\u03b1 signaling \naxis.

Therefore, \nthe aim of this study was to compare the effects between cold-water immersion \n(CWI) conduction and partial-body cryotherapy (PBC) convection on perfusion of \nthe microcirculation and skin temperature on the thigh.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy males were randomly allocated to CWI (10\u00b0C \nfor 10\u00a0minutes) or PBC (-60\u00b0C for 30\u00a0seconds, -135\u00b0C for 2\u00a0minutes).

PBC increased perfusion of the \nmicrocirculation and decreased skin temperature only at the first measurement \ninterval (0\u00a0minute, both P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) post-treatment. Additionally, local skin \ntemperature was significantly decreased compared to baseline values only after \nCWI up to 30\u00a0minutes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) post-treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Cold-water immersion reduced local skin microcirculation and skin \ntemperature while PBC only slightly increased the perfusion of the \nmicrocirculation immediately after the treatment.

J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1266-1275, 2019-The objective of this study \nwas to propose a mathematical model to analyze the post-training recovery of \nperceptive, functional, metabolic, and autonomic parameters from the use of cold \nwater immersion (CWI) through isolated and combined analysis. Following \nsimulated training, 64 male soccer players were randomized into an experimental \ngroup (EG: CWI, 13 \u00b1 1\u00b0 C; 15 minutes) and a control group (CG: passive \nrecovery; 15 minutes). Perceptive (soreness and perception of recovery), \nautonomic (heart rate variability [HRV]), metabolic (lactate concentration), and \nfunctional parameters (squat jump, T agility test, sprint test, 40-second test, \nand maximal voluntary isometric contraction) were analyzed before and at \nspecific moments after training (without exceeding 2 hours after training). The \nvariables were analyzed using the raw data, dichotomization of each variable \n(isolated analysis), and through a mathematical model using the combination of \nall parameters analyzed (combined analysis). The combined analysis did not \ndemonstrate better efficacy of the EG compared with the CG (69.17 and 63.4%, p = \n0.09). In the isolated analysis, a chance of the technique being better was \nobserved in the metabolic parameter at 1 and 2 hours after training (odds ratio, \n95% confidence interval = 3.75 [1.01-13.88] and 11.11 [1.25-98.49]), \nrespectively, and in the autonomic parameter at 40-45 minutes after training \n(4.4 [1.09-17.67]). For the raw data, all parameters analyzed presented recovery \nby 2 hours after training for both groups. Based on the proposed mathematical \nmodel, it is concluded that CWI is not better than the control condition. \nHowever, considering the analysis of variables in isolation, the technique \npresents a better chance of recovery for blood lactate concentration and HRV.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000003041\nPMID: 30882563 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Previously, we \nreported the effects of RBE containing cyclo(d-Phe-l-Pro) on blood flow in \nanimals and humans and investigated rapid skin temperature recovery from \ncold-water immersion in women. The present randomized, double-blind study \ninvestigated the effects of RBE containing cyclo(d-Phe-l-Pro) on men's and \nwomen's skin temperature in excessively air-cooled conditions. Participants felt \ncold in the test room (25.5\u00b10.5\u00baC). They ingested an RBE or placebo beverage and \nremained in the air-conditioned room for 100 min. Skin temperature of the left \nfoot was measured every 5 min using infrared thermography. We evaluated effect \nof RBE administration by paired t-test. The skin temperature of the RBE group \nremained higher than that of the placebo group. The skin temperature changes 100 \nmin after RBE or placebo ingestion were -3.67\u00b11.14\u00baC and -4.59\u00b10.89\u00baC, \nrespectively in all participants. We also did subclass analysis focusing on men \nor women. In a previous study, RBE efficacy for skin temperature in men was not \nclearly demonstrated. RBE consumption was also effective not only in female \nparticipants but also in male participants. The skin temperature changes 100 min \nafter RBE or placebo ingestion were -3.65\u00b10.64\u00baC and -4.55\u00b10.32\u00baC, respectively \nin male participants.

Before clinicians can advocate PC as an EHS \nprevention strategy, it must effectively mitigate factors associated with EHS \ndevelopment while not lessening the effectiveness of EHS treatment. Therefore, \nthis study determined if PC affected rectal temperature (Trec), body heat \nstorage, heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), thermal \nsensation, sweat rate, and postexercise cold-water immersion (CWI) Trec cooling \nrates.METHODS: In this randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, 12 subjects \n(6 men, 6 women; age = 22 \u00b1 2 yr; mass = 73.5 \u00b1 7.9 kg; height = 171 \u00b1 7 cm) \nunderwent 15 min of CWI (10.0 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0C) in an environmental chamber (38.6 \u00b1 \n0.6\u00b0C; 36 \u00b1 2% humidity). After a 10-min rest, they exercised to a Trec of \n39.5\u00b0C. Subsequently, they underwent CWI (9.99 \u00b1 0.03\u00b0C) until Trec reached \n38\u00b0C. On control (CON) days, the same procedures occurred without the 15-min PC \nintervention. Trec, HR, thermal sensation, and RPE were measured at various \ntimes before, during, and after exercise.RESULTS: PC lowered body heat storage \nand Trec by 15.7 \u00b1 15.0 W \u00b7 m-2 and 0.42 \u00b1 0.40\u00b0C, respectively, before \nexercise. Subjects exercised significantly longer (PC = 66.7 \u00b1 16.3 min, CON = \n45.7 \u00b1 9.5 min) and at lower Trec (\u223c0.5 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C) and HR (\u223c10 \u00b1 7 bpm) following \nPC. PC significantly lowered sweat rate (PC = 1.02 \u00b1 0.31 L \u00b7 h-1, CON = 1.22 \u00b1 \n0.39 L \u00b7 h-1), but did not affect RPE or CWI cooling rates (PC = 0.18 \u00b1 0.14\u00b0C \u00b7 \nmin-1; CON = 0.19 \u00b1 0.05\u00b0C \u00b7 min-1). Thermal sensation significantly differed \nbetween conditions only at pre-exercise (PC = 3 \u00b1 1, CON = 5 \u00b1 0.5).DISCUSSION: \nPC delayed severe hyperthermia and mitigated dehydration without affecting \nthermal perception or cooling rates posthyperthermia.

In a randomized design, eight soccer players completed the Loughborough \nIntermittent Shuttle Test followed by 10\u202fmin of either CWI (10C\u00b0) or \nthermoneutral water immersion (TWI) (28C\u00b0). Physical performance (Squat jump: \nSJ, countermovement jump: CMJ, maximal voluntary contraction: MVC, and 20\u202fm \nsprint: SP), muscle damage parameter (creatine kinase: CK) and perceived muscle \nsoreness were assessed at baseline, 0\u202fh, 24\u202fh, 48\u202fh and 72\u202fh after the \nintermittent test. After the test, a decrease was observed in SJ and in CMJ at \n0\u202fh, 24\u202fh, 48\u202fh and 72\u202fh with TWI (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and only at 0\u202fh for SJ with CWI \n(p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

Countermovement jump height, muscle soreness and perceived \nrecovery and stress were measured 24h before the half-marathon (pre), \nimmediately after the recovery intervention (postrec) and 24h after the race \n(post24). In addition, muscle contractile properties and blood markers of \nfatigue were determined at pre and post24.\nRESULTS: Magnitude-based inferences revealed substantial differences in the \nchanges between the groups. At postrec, ACT was harmful to perceived recovery \n(ACT vs. PAS: effect size [ES] = -1.81) and serum concentration of creatine \nkinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = 0.42), with CWI being harmful to jump performance (CWI \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.98). It was also beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.88) and improving perceived stress (CWI vs. PAS: ES = -0.64), \nwith MAS being beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (MAS vs. PAS: ES = -0.52) \nand improving perceived recovery (MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.00). At post24, both CWI \nand MAS were still beneficial for reducing muscle soreness (CWI vs. PAS: ES = \n1.49; MAS vs. PAS: ES = 1.12), with ACT being harmful to perceived recovery (ACT \nvs. PAS: ES = -0.68), serum concentration of creatine kinase (ACT vs. PAS: ES = \n0.84) and free-testosterone (ACT vs. PAS: ES = -0.91).\nCONCLUSIONS: In recreational runners, a half-marathon results in fatigue \nsymptoms lasting at least 24h. To restore subjective fatigue measures, the \nauthors recommend CWI and MAS, as these recovery strategies are more effective \nthan PAS, with ACT being even disadvantageous.

The 20 \nmale footballers, aged 17 to 20 years, were divided into two groups (n = 10 for \neach) following a random draw. The two groups were age-, height- and weight \nmatched. 1000-m race was made during the two periods. Heart-rate (HR, % of \ntheoretical maximum HR) and hemoglobin oxygen saturation (Oxy-sat, %) were \nmeasured before and after the race, and the time of the race (min) was noted. An \nOxy-sat decrease > 4 points retained the diagnosis of exercise-induced \ndesaturation. Eight CWI sessions (one per week), until the hip in a standing \nposition (10 min; temperature: 11-12 \u00b0C) were performed.\nRESULTS: The two groups were age-, height- and weight matched.

Comparatively to the HRs (before, after the race) of \n\u00abperiod1\u00bb, these of \u00abperiod2\u00bb were decreased in the CWI group (36\u00b11 vs. 34\u00b11%; \n56\u00b13 vs. 44\u00b12%) and were increased in the no-CWI group (35\u00b12 vs. 36\u00b11%; 55\u00b12 vs. \n57\u00b12%). Comparatively to the after race Oxy-sat' of the \u00abperiod1\u00bb, this of \n\u00abperiod2\u00bb was increased in the CWI group (96\u00b11 vs. 98\u00b10%) and was decreased in \nthe no-CWI group (96\u00b11 vs. 95\u00b11%). While in the CWI group, the percent of \ndesaturators was decreased between \u00abperiod1\u00bb and \u00abperiod2\u00bb (30 vs. 0%), in the \nno-CWI group, percentages remained similar (50 vs. 90%).\nCONCLUSION: CWI improves aerobic capacity and muscle strength of young \nfootballers.\n\nPMID: 30324975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-two professional male rugby players were randomized into \nCWI (10 \u00b0C\/10 min; n = 11) or control (CON: 30 min seated; n = 11) groups. \nActivity profile from Global Positioning Satellite systems and postmatch rating \nof perceived exertion were measured to determined match load. Biochemical (tumor \nnecrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6), neuromuscular performance (squat \n(SJ) and countermovement jumps (CMJ), peak power output (PPO), rate of force \ndevelopment (RFD), stiffness, 10- and 30-m sprint time, and perceptual markers \n(soreness, perceived recovery) were obtained before and immediately after the \nmatch, and then at 30 min, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after the match. Magnitude-based \ninference and Cohen's effect size (ES) were used to analyze change over time and \nbetween groups. Thus, the higher\/beneficial, similar\/trivial, or lower\/harmful \ndifferences were evaluated as follows: <1%, almost certainly not; 1% to 5%, very \nunlikely; 5% to 25%, unlikely; 25% to 75%, possible; 75% to 95%, likely; 95% to \n99%, very likely; >99%, almost certainly. Changes were unclear for the match \nloads, sprint times, and perceptual markers between groups. Higher %\u0394SJ at 24 h \n(very likely (ES = 0.75)) and in %\u0394PPO_SJ at 48 h (likely (ES = 0.51)) were \nobserved in CWI than in CON. Values in %\u0394RDF_CMJ were higher immediately after \n(likely (ES = 0.83)), 30 min after (very likely (ES = 0.97)), and 24 h after the \nmatch (likely (ES = 0.93)) in CWI than in CON. Furthermore, %\u0394log TNF-\u03b1 were \nlower in the CWI group than in the CON group immediately after (almost certainly \n(ES = -0.76)), 24 h after (very likely (ES = -1.09)), and 72 h after the match \n(likely (ES = -0.51)), and in \u0394stiffness_SJ at 30 min after (likely (ES = \n-0.67)) and 48 h after the match (very likely (ES = -0.97)).

Precise mechanisms of OA are still not \nelucidated and studies are needed to evaluate factors modulating OA. The aim of \nthis study was to investigate OA before and during tonic cold pain (thought to \ninduce descending inhibition), in a group of healthy volunteers. Methods A \nrandomized, crossover study was performed in 17 healthy participants (8 males \nand 9 females). The OA paradigm lasted 35 s and was induced by the traditional \nmethod using thermal stimulation applied to the forearm. A constant control heat \nstimulus (CTL) paradigm was used as control to assess adaptation. Pain intensity \nwas assessed continuously. For induction of tonic cold pain, the participants \nimmersed their hand into 2\u00b0C water for 2 min. After 1 min and 25 s, the heat \nstimulation (OA or CTL paradigm) was repeated to assess the modulatory effect of \nthe cold pressor test. Results It was possible to induce OA both before and \nduring the cold pressor test. Tonic cold pain modulated the peak pain reported \nduring both the OA (p=0.015) and CTL paradigms (p=0.001) reflecting endogenous \npain modulation. However, the magnitude of OA was not modulated by tonic cold \npain (p>0.05). Conclusions The offset analgesia magnitude was not modulated by \nsimultaneously tonic cold pain, thought to reflect another endogenous pain \nmodulation mechanism. Implications Neither offset analgesia magnitude nor \nadaptation were modulated by cold pressor induced endogenous analgesia. This \ncould be explained by the fact, that offset analgesia was already at maximum in \nhealthy participants. Hence, offset analgesia may not be a suitable assessment \ntool to investigate modulation induced by experimental methods or pharmacology \nin healthy participants.\n\nDOI: 10.1515\/sjpain-2018-0082\nPMID: 30307901 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Recent findings suggest that temporarily \nincreasing optimism by means of imagining a positive future may also have \npain-alleviating effects.\nOBJECTIVES: The present experiment was designed to investigate conditioned pain \nmodulation (CPM) as a potential underlying mechanism of this pain-alleviating \neffect of induced optimism.\nMETHODS: For this purpose, 45 healthy participants were randomized into an \noptimistic or neutral imagery condition. Additionally, participants completed \nquestionnaires on dispositional optimism, pain catastrophizing and pain \nexpectations. CPM was assessed by delivering a series of five heat pain stimuli \non the nondominant hand before and during immersion of the dominant hand in \nwater of 5\u00b0C for 70\u00a0s.\nRESULTS: A clear CPM effect was found, that is heat pain reports were lower \nduring simultaneous cold water stimulation. Although the optimism manipulation \nsuccessfully increased optimism, it did not affect pain ratings or CPM. Post hoc \nanalyses indicated that dispositional optimism was not associated with the \nmagnitude of CPM, but pain catastrophizing and pain expectations did \nsignificantly correlate with the CPM effect.\nCONCLUSION: Pain-specific but not general cognitions appear to influence \nendogenous pain modulation.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Conditioned pain modulation is not the underlying mechanism of the \npain-alleviating effects of induced optimism.

In this study, we investigated whether \ncyclo(d-Phe-l-Pro)-containing RBE prevents the decrease in the cutaneous blood \nflow and skin temperature. Subjects remained in the air-conditioned room while \ningesting RBE or a placebo. We measured the cutaneous blood flow and skin \ntemperature. We evaluated the effect of RBE administration by two-way repeated \nmeasures analysis of variance. A total of 15 subjects were enrolled. The change \nin cutaneous blood flow in the RBE and placebo groups was -0.79 \u00b1 0.38 and -2.03 \n\u00b1 0.35 mL min-1 100 g-1, respectively ( p value of 0.041). The change in the \nskin temperature in the RBE and placebo groups was -1.85 \u00b1 0.35 and -3.02 \u00b1 0.30 \n\u00b0C, respectively ( p value of <0.001). We also did subclass analysis with \ncold-feeling subjects. For the seven subjects who had cold sensation, the change \nin the cutaneous blood flow in the RBE and placebo groups was -0.48 \u00b1 0.58 and \n-2.56 \u00b1 0.48 mL min-1 100 g-1, respectively ( p value of 0.008). The change in \nthe skin temperature in the RBE and placebo groups was -1.46 \u00b1 0.74 and -2.89 \u00b1 \n0.39 \u00b0C, respectively ( p value of 0.009). Thus, RBE containing \ncyclo(d-Phe-l-Pro) prevents the decrease in the cutaneous blood flow and skin \ntemperature under air conditioning.\n\nDOI: 10.1021\/acs.jafc.8b02485\nPMID: 29792425 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We investigated the effects of menthol-induced \nactivation of cutaneous cold receptors on the cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) \nof the finger. We hypothesized that the menthol application would attenuate \ntypical CIVD responses.\nMETHODS: 1.5% L-menthol was fully applied over the left hand and forearm, and \nthen, the middle finger of the left hand was immersed into 4\u00a0\u00b0C water for \n30\u00a0min. A trial consisted of 10-min rest followed by 30-min immersion and 20-min \nrecovery in 28\u00a0\u00b0C air temperature with 20% relative humidity. Another trial \nwithout the menthol application was carried out as a control. Seventeen females \n(24.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6\u00a0years in age, 160.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1\u00a0cm in height, and 51.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.7\u00a0kg in body \nweight) participated in the two trials.\nRESULTS: The results showed that the maximum and average temperatures of the \nfinger during the water immersion were lower in the menthol application when \ncompared to control (P\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas no significant differences appeared in \nthe onset time of CIVD, the frequency of CIVD, and minimum finger temperature. \nThese results imply that stronger stimulation of cold receptors without \nadditional conductive skin cooling did not attenuate the triggering of CIVD \nresponses but intensified vasoconstriction after the first occurrence of CIVD.\nCONCLUSION: It is suggested that substantial and conductive heat loss through \nthe skin along with activation of cold receptors may be required to retain \nrewarming at a certain level.\n\nDOI: 10.1186\/s40101-018-0174-x\nPMCID: PMC5941682\nPMID: 29739454 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: All \nprocedures involving human participants were performed in accordance with the \nethical standards of the institutional research committee.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the influence of CWI \nimmediately following an Ironman triathlon on markers of muscle damage, \ninflammation and muscle soreness.\nDESIGN: Prospective cohort study.\nMETHODS: Thirty three (22 male, 11 female), triathletes participating in the \nIronman World Championships volunteered to participate (mean\u00b1SD: age=40\u00b111years; \nheight=174.5\u00b19.1cm; body mass=70\u00b111.8kg; percent body fat=11.4\u00b14.1%, finish \ntime=11:03.00\u00b101:25.08). Post race, participants were randomly assigned to a \n10-min bout of 10\u00b0C CWI or no-intervention control group. Data collection \noccurred pre-intervention (PRE), post-intervention (POST), 16h (16POST) and 40h \n(40POST) following the race. Linear mixed model ANOVA with Bonferroni \ncorrections were performed to examine group by time differences for delayed \nonset muscle soreness (DOMS), hydration indices, myoglobin, creatine kinase \n(CK), cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 and percent body mass loss \n(%BML). Pearson's bivariate correlations were used for comparisons with \nfinishing time. Alpha level was set a priori at 0.05.\nRESULTS: No significant group by time interactions occurred. Significant \ndifferences occurred for POST BML (-1.7\u00b10.9kg) vs. 16POST, and 40POST BML \n(0.9\u00b11.4, -0.1\u00b11.2kg, respectively; p<0.001). Compared to PRE, myoglobin, CRP \nand CK remained significantly elevated at 40POST. Cortisol returned to PRE \nvalues by 16POST and IL-6 returned to PRE values by 40POST.\nCONCLUSION: A single bout of CWI did not provide any physiological benefit \nduring recovery from a triathlon within 40h post race. Effect of CWI beyond this \ntime is unknown.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This \nstudy compared the effects of cold water immersion, with (CMWI) and without \n(CWI) menthol, on the recovery of cycling performance. Eight heat-acclimatized \ncyclists (age, 24.1 \u00b1 4.4 years; mass, 65.3 \u00b1 5.2 kg) performed 2 randomized \nsessions, each consisting of a 20-min cycling trial (T1) followed by 10 min of \nimmersion during recovery and then a second 20-min cycling trial (T2). Mean \npower output and perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded for both trials. Rectal \n(Trec) and skin temperatures were measured before and immediately after T1, \nimmersion, and T2. Perceived thermal sensation (TS) and comfort were measured \nimmediately after T1 and T2. Power output was significantly improved in T2 \ncompared with T1 in the CMWI condition (+15.6%). Performance did not change in \nthe CWI condition. After immersion, Trec was lower in CWI (-1.17 \u00b0C) than in \nCMWI (-0.6 \u00b0C). TS decreased significantly after immersion in both conditions. \nThis decline was significantly more pronounced in CMWI (5.9 \u00b1 1 to 3.6 \u00b1 0.5) \nthan in CWI (5.6 \u00b1 0.9 to 4.4 \u00b1 1.2).

Although pain patients report \ngreater analgesia when cannabis is used with opioids, no placebo-controlled \nstudies have assessed the direct effects of opioids combined with cannabis in \nhumans or the impact of the combination on abuse liability. This double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, within-subject study determined if cannabis enhances the \nanalgesic effects of low dose oxycodone using a validated experimental model of \npain and its effects on abuse liability. Healthy cannabis smokers (N\u2009=\u200918) were \nadministered oxycodone (0, 2.5, and 5.0\u2009mg, PO) with smoked cannabis (0.0, 5.6% \n\u03949 tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) and analgesia was assessed using the Cold-Pressor \nTest (CPT). Participants immersed their hand in cold water (4\u2009\u00b0C); times to \nreport pain (pain threshold) and withdraw the hand from the water (pain \ntolerance) were recorded. Abuse-related effects were measured and effects of \noxycodone on cannabis self-administration were determined. Alone, 5.0\u2009mg \noxycodone increased pain threshold and tolerance (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). Although active \ncannabis and 2.5\u2009mg oxycodone alone failed to elicit analgesia, combined they \nincreased pain threshold and tolerance (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). Oxycodone did not increase \nsubjective ratings associated with cannabis abuse, nor did it increase cannabis \nself-administration. However, the combination of 2.5\u2009mg oxycodone and active \ncannabis produced small, yet significant, increases in oxycodone abuse liability \n(p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05).

Twitches and maximal voluntary contractions \nwere performed prior to, and after, forearm immersion in neutral or cold water. \nMotor unit properties were assessed during trapezoidal contractions to 50% \nbaseline force using surface EMG decomposition.\nRESULTS: Impaired contractile properties from muscle cooling were evident in the \ntwitch amplitude, duration, and rate of force development indicating that the \nmuscle was successfully cooled from the cold water bath (all d\u2009\u2265\u20090.5, P\u2009<\u20090.05). \nSurface EMG decomposition showed muscle cooling increased the number of motor \nunits (d\u2009=\u20090.7, P\u2009=\u20090.01) and motor unit action potential (MUAP) duration \n(d\u2009=\u20090.6, P\u2009<\u20090.001), but decreased MUAP amplitude (d\u2009=\u20090.2, P\u2009=\u20090.012). \nIndividually, neither motor unit firing rates (d\u2009=\u20090.1, P\u2009=\u20090.843) nor \nrecruitment threshold (d\u2009=\u20090.1, P\u2009=\u20090.746) changed; however, the relationship \nbetween the recruitment threshold and motor unit firing rate was steeper \n(d\u2009=\u20091.0, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and had an increased y-intercept (d\u2009=\u20090.9, P\u2009=\u20090.007) with \nmuscle cooling.\nCONCLUSIONS: Since muscle contractility is impaired with muscle cooling, these \nfindings suggest a compensatory increase in the number of active motor units, \nand small but coupled changes in motor unit firing rates and recruitment \nthreshold to produce the same force.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-017-3782-y\nPMID: 29222596 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Using an open-label, 2\u00d72 crossover \nrandomization design, both feet of each subject were immersed in 15 \u00b0C water for \ncold stress (CS) and in 40 \u00b0C water for heat stress (HS) for 5 min each. Radial \npulse, respiration and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals were recorded before, \nduring and immediately after the TSs.\nRESULTS: The analysis of heart rate variability revealed that CS increased the \nlow-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components (P <0.05) and that HS \nreduced the LF and HF components (P <0.01). Both TSs reduced the normalized LF, \nincreased the normalized HF, and reduced the LF\/HF ratio. The differences in the \nECG signals were more dominant during the TS sessions, but those in the radial \npulse signals became more dominant immediately after the TS sessions. CS \ndecreased the pulse depth (P <0.01) and increased the radial augmentation index \n(P <0.1), and HS increased the pulse pressure (P <0.1) and subendocardial \nviability ratio (P <0.01). There were no significant differences in pulse rate \nduring the three time sequences of each TS. The respiration rate was increased \n(P <0.1), and the pulse rate per respiration (P\/R ratio) was significantly \ndecreased (P <0.05) with CS. The HF region (10-30 Hz) of the pulse spectral \ndensity was suppressed during both TSs.\nCONCLUSIONS: CS induced vasoconstriction and sympathetic reactions, and HS \ninduced vasodilation and parasympathetic reactions. Based on definitions used in \npulse diagnosis, we made the novel discoveries that the pulse became slower \n(decreased P\/R ratio), more floating and tenser under CS and that the HF region \nof the spectral power decreased significantly under both TSs.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s11655-017-2972-0\nPMID: 29150789 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of whole \nbody cryotherapy (WBC) and cold water immersion (CWI) on markers of recovery \nfollowing a marathon.\nMETHODS: Thirty-one endurance trained males completed a marathon.

Blood samples were taken at \nbaseline, post intervention and 24 and 48\u00a0h post intervention to assess \ninflammation and muscle damage.\nRESULTS: WBC had a harmful effect on muscle function compared to CWI post \nmarathon. WBC positively influenced perceptions of training stress compared to \nCWI. With the exception of C-reactive protein (CRP) at 24 and 48\u00a0h, neither \ncryotherapy intervention positively influenced blood borne markers of \ninflammation or structural damage compared to placebo.\nCONCLUSION: The findings show WBC has a negative impact on muscle function, \nperceptions of soreness and a number of blood parameters compared to CWI, \ncontradicting the suggestion that WBC may be a superior recovery strategy. \nFurther, cryotherapy is no more effective than a placebo intervention at \nimproving functional recovery or perceptions of training stress following a \nmarathon.

We used painful cutaneous \nelectrical stimulation (PCES) to induce TS in a novel CPM-model. Additionally, \nto evaluate a more objective parameter, we recorded the corresponding changes of \ncortical evoked potentials (PCES-EP).\nMETHODS: We examined the CPM-effect in 17 healthy subjects in a randomized \ncontrolled cross-over design during immersion of the non-dominant hand into \n10\u00a0\u00b0C or 24\u00a0\u00b0C cold water (CS). Using three custom-built concentric surface \nelectrodes, electrical stimuli were applied on the dominant hand, inducing pain \nof 40-60 on NRS 0-100 (TS). At baseline, during and after CS we assessed the \nelectrically induced pain intensity and electrically evoked potentials recorded \nover the central electrode (Cz).\nRESULTS: Only in the 10\u00a0\u00b0C-condition, both pain (52.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4 (baseline) vs. \n30.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.5 (during CS)) and amplitudes of PCES-EP (42.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.4\u00a0\u03bcV (baseline) \nvs. 28.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.5\u00a0\u03bcV (during CS)) attenuated during CS and recovered there after \n(all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the 10\u00a0\u00b0C-condition changes of subjective pain ratings \nduring electrical stimulation and amplitudes of PCES-EP correlated significantly \nwith each other (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5) and with CS pain intensity (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5).\nCONCLUSIONS: PCES-EPs are a quantitative measure of pain relief, as changes in \nthe electrophysiological response are paralleled by a consistent decrease in \nsubjective pain ratings.

Sixteen of these participants also completed 6 wk of SIT, each \nsession followed immediately by their designated recovery condition. Four muscle \nbiopsies were obtained in total, three during the single SIT session \n(preexercise, postrecovery, and 3 h postrecovery) and one 48 h after the last \nSIT session. After a single SIT session, phosphorylated (p-)AMPK, p-p38 MAPK, \np-p53, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) \nmRNA were all increased (P < 0.05). Postexercise CWI had no effect on these \nresponses. Consistent with the lack of a response after a single session, \nregular postexercise CWI had no effect on PGC-1\u03b1 or p53 protein content. Six \nweeks of SIT increased peak aerobic power, maximal oxygen consumption, maximal \nuncoupled respiration (complexes I and II), and 2-km time trial performance (P < \n0.05). However, regular CWI had no effect on changes in these markers, \nconsistent with the lack of response in the markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. \nAlthough these observations suggest that CWI is not detrimental to endurance \nadaptations following 6 wk of SIT, they question whether postexercise CWI is an \neffective strategy to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and improvements in \nendurance performance.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 the American Physiological Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/ajpregu.00434.2016\nPMID: 28679683 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This study investigated how brain activity at rest and exposed to tonic \npain is modified by oxycodone (opioid) and venlafaxine (SNRI).\nMETHODS: Twenty healthy males were included in this randomized, cross-over, \ndouble-blinded study. 61-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded before \nand after five days of treatment with placebo, oxycodone (10\u00a0mg extended release \nb.i.d) or venlafaxine (37.5\u00a0mg extended release b.i.d) at rest and during tonic \npain (hand immersed in 2\u00a0\u00b0C water for 80\u00a0s). Subjective pain and unpleasantness \nscores of tonic pain were recorded. Spectral analysis and sLORETA source \nlocalization were done in delta (1-4\u00a0Hz), theta (4-8\u00a0Hz), alpha (8-12\u00a0Hz), beta1 \n(12-18\u00a0Hz) and beta2 (18-32\u00a0Hz) frequency bands.\nRESULTS: Oxycodone decreased pain and unpleasantness scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas \nvenlafaxine decreased the pain scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). None of the treatments changed \nthe spectral indices or brain sources underlying resting EEG. Venlafaxine \ndecreased spectral indices in alpha band of the EEG to tonic pain, whereas \noxycodone decreased the spectral indices and brain source activity in delta and \ntheta frequency bands (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The brain source activity predominantly \ndecreased in the insula and inferior frontal gyrus.\nCONCLUSION: The decrease of activity within insula and inferior frontal gyrus is \nlikely involved in pain inhibition due to oxycodone treatment, whereas the \ndecrease in alpha activity is likely involved in pain inhibition due to \nvenlafaxine treatment.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The participants in each \ngroup underwent the same fatigue protocol followed by their allocated recovery \nintervention, which lasted for 1 minute. Measurements were taken before and \nafter the fatigue-recovery intervention. The primary outcomes were the sensory \norganization test (SOT) composite equilibrium score (ES) and the \ncondition-specific ES, which were measured using a computerized dynamic \nposturography machine. The secondary outcome was the knee joint repositioning \nerror. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test the \neffect of water immersion on each outcome variable.\nRESULTS: There were no significant within- and between-group differences in the \nSOT composite ESs or the condition-specific ESs. However, there was a \ngroup-by-time interaction effect on the knee joint repositioning error. It seems \nthat participants in the RWI group had lower errors over time, but those in the \nIWI and control groups had increased errors over time. The RWI group had \nsignificantly lower error score than the IWI group at postintervention.\nCONCLUSION: One minute of postexercise IWI or RWI did not impair rugby players' \nsensory organization of balance control. RWI had a less detrimental effect on \nknee joint proprioception to IWI at postintervention.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/MD.0000000000006146\nPMCID: PMC5319535\nPMID: 28207546 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have no funding and conflicts of \ninterest to disclose.",

The aim of this \nstudy was to compare the effects of ecologically valid CWI and WBC protocols on \npostexercise lower limb thermoregulatory, femoral artery, and cutaneous blood \nflow responses.\nMETHODS: Ten males completed a continuous cycle exercise protocol at 70% maximal \noxygen uptake until a rectal temperature of 38\u00b0C was attained. Participants were \nthen exposed to lower-body CWI (8\u00b0C) for 10 min, or WBC (-110\u00b0C) for 2 min, in a \nrandomized crossover design. Rectal and thigh skin, deep, and superficial muscle \ntemperatures, thigh, and calf skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry), \nsuperficial femoral artery blood flow (duplex ultrasound), and arterial blood \npressure were measured before, and for 40 min post, cooling interventions.\nRESULTS: Greater reductions in thigh skin (CWI, -5.9\u00b0C \u00b1 1.8\u00b0C; WBC, 0.2\u00b0C \u00b1 \n0.5\u00b0C; P < 0.001) and superficial (CWI, -4.4\u00b0C \u00b1 1.3\u00b0C; WBC, -1.8\u00b0C \u00b1 1.1\u00b0C; P < \n0.001) and deep (CWI, -2.9\u00b0C \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C; WBC, -1.3\u00b0C \u00b1 0.6\u00b0C; P < 0.001) muscle \ntemperatures occurred immediately after CWI. Decreases in femoral artery \nconductance were greater after CWI (CWI, -84% \u00b1 11%; WBC, -59% \u00b1 21%, P < 0.02) \nand thigh (CWI, -80% \u00b1 5%; WBC, -59% \u00b1 14%, P < 0.001), and calf (CWI, -73% \u00b1 \n13%; WBC, -45% \u00b1 17%, P < 0.001) cutaneous vasoconstriction was greater after \nCWI. Reductions in rectal temperature were similar between conditions after \ncooling (CWI, -0.6\u00b0C \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C; WBC, -0.6\u00b0C \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C; P = 0.98).\nCONCLUSION: Greater reductions in blood flow and tissue temperature were \nobserved after CWI in comparison with WBC. These novel findings have practical \nand clinical implications for the use of cooling in the recovery from exercise \nand injury.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0000000000001223\nPMID: 28141620 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Therefore \nit is important to study the issue of dose response in a specific stress model. \nThus the objective was to analyze and compare the effects of CWI during intense \npost-exercise recovery using different durations and temperatures of immersion.\nMETHODS: One hundred and five male individuals were divided into five groups: \none control group (CG) and four recovery groups (G1: 5' at 9\u00b11 \u00b0C; G2: 5' at \n14\u00b11 \u00b0C; G3: 15' at 9\u00b11 \u00b0C; G4: 15' at 14\u00b11 \u00b0C). The volunteers were submitted \nto an exhaustion protocol that consisted of a jump program and the Wingate Test. \nImmediately after the exhaustion protocol, the volunteers were directed to a \ntank with water and ice, where they were immersed for the recovery procedure, \nduring which blood samples were collected for later lactate and creatine kinase \n(CK) analysis. Variables were collected prior to the exercise and 24, 48, 72, \nand 96 hours after its completion.\nRESULTS: For the CK concentration, 15 minutes at 14 \u00b0C was the best intervention \noption, considering the values at 72 hours after exercise, while for the moment \nof peak lactate an advantage was observed for immersion for 5 minutes at 14 \u00b0C. \nRegarding the perception of recovery, CWI for 5 minutes at 14 \u00b0C performed \nbetter long-term, from the time of the intervention to 96 hours post-exercise. \nFor pain, no form of immersion responded better than the CG at the immediately \npost-intervention moment.\nCONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in behavior between the CWI intervention \ngroups for the outcomes studied.\n\nDOI: 10.23736\/S0022-4707.17.06841-4\nPMID: 28116880 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Opioids may exert their effect on both cortical and \nspinal levels. In this study actions of morphine at both levels were \ninvestigated, followed by analysis of a possible correlation between the \ncortical processing and spinal transmission.\nMETHODS: The study was conducted after a double-blinded, two-way crossover \ndesign in thirty-nine healthy participants. Each participant received 30mg \nmorphine or placebo as oral solution in randomized order. The \nelectroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during rest and during immersion of the \nhand into ice-water. Electrical stimulation of the sole of the foot was used to \nelicit the nociceptive withdrawal reflex and the reflex amplitude was recorded.\nRESULTS: Data from thirty subjects was included in the data analysis. There was \nno change in the activity in resting EEG (P>0.05) after morphine administration \nas compared to placebo. During cold pressor stimulation, morphine significantly \nlowered the relative activity in the delta (1-4Hz) band (P=0.03) and increased \nthe activity in the alpha (8-12Hz) band (P=0.001) as compared to placebo. The \nreflex amplitudes significantly decreased after morphine administration \n(P=0.047) as compared to placebo. There was no correlation between individual \nEEG changes during cold pressor stimulation and the decrease in the reflex \namplitude after morphine administration (P>0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Cold pressor EEG and the nociceptive reflex were more sensitive to \nmorphine analgesia than resting EEG and can be used as standardized objective \nmethods to assess opioid effects. However, no correlation between the analgesic \neffect of morphine on the spinal and cortical assessments could be demonstrated.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, remote locations or monetary or spatial \nrestrictions can challenge the feasibility of CWI. Thus, the development of a \nmodified, portable CWI method would allow for optimal treatment of exertional \nheat stroke in the presence of these challenges.\nOBJECTIVE: \u2003To determine the cooling rate of modified CWI (tarp-assisted cooling \nwith oscillation [TACO]) after exertional hyperthermia.\nDESIGN: \u2003Randomized, crossover controlled trial.\nSETTING: \u2003Environmental chamber (temperature = 33.4\u00b0C \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C, relative humidity \n= 55.7% \u00b1 1.9%).\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: \u2003Sixteen volunteers (9 men, 7 women; age = 26 \u00b1 \n4.7 years, height = 1.76 \u00b1 0.09 m, mass = 72.5 \u00b1 9.0 kg, body fat = 20.7% \u00b1 \n7.1%) with no history of compromised thermoregulation.\nINTERVENTION(S): \u2003Participants completed volitional exercise (cycling or \ntreadmill) until they demonstrated a rectal temperature (Tre) \u226539.0\u00b0C. After \nexercise, participants transitioned to a semirecumbent position on a tarp until \neither Tre reached 38.1\u00b0C or 15 minutes had elapsed during the control (no \nimmersion [CON]) or TACO (immersion in 151 L of 2.1\u00b0C \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C water) treatment.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): \u2003The Tre, heart rate, and blood pressure (reported as \nmean arterial pressure) were assessed precooling and postcooling. Statistical \nanalyses included repeated-measures analysis of variance with appropriate post \nhoc t tests and Bonferroni correction.\nRESULTS: \u2003Before cooling, the Tre was not different between conditions (CON: \n39.27\u00b0C \u00b1 0.26\u00b0C, TACO: 39.30\u00b0C \u00b1 0.39\u00b0C; P = .62; effect size = -0.09; 95% \nconfidence interval [CI] = -0.2, 0.1). At postcooling, the Tre was decreased in \nthe TACO (38.10\u00b0C \u00b1 0.16\u00b0C) compared with the CON condition (38.74\u00b0C \u00b1 0.38\u00b0C; P \n< .001; effect size = 2.27; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.9). The rate of cooling was greater \nduring the TACO (0.14 \u00b1 0.06\u00b0C\/min) than the CON treatment (0.04\u00b0C\/min \u00b1 \n0.02\u00b0C\/min; t15 = -8.84; P < .001; effect size = 2.21; 95% CI = -0.13, -0.08). \nThese differences occurred despite an insignificant increase in fluid \nconsumption during exercise preceding CON (0.26 \u00b1 0.29 L) versus TACO (0.19 \u00b1 \n0.26 L; t12 = 1.73; P = .11; effect size = 0.48; 95% CI = -0.02, 0.14) \ntreatment. Decreases in heart rate did not differ between the TACO and CON \nconditions (t15 = -1.81; P = .09; effect size = 0.45; 95% CI = -22, 2). Mean \narterial pressure was greater at postcooling with TACO (84.2 \u00b1 6.6 mm Hg) than \nwith CON (67.0 \u00b1 9.0 mm Hg; P < .001; effect size = 2.25; 95% CI = 13, 21).\nCONCLUSIONS: \u2003The TACO treatment provided faster cooling than did the CON \ntreatment. When location, monetary, or spatial restrictions are present, TACO \nrepresents an effective alternative to traditional CWI in the emergency \ntreatment of patients with exertional hyperthermia.\n\nDOI: 10.4085\/1062-6050-51.12.07\nPMCID: PMC5224736\nPMID: 27874299 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Epub 2016 \nJun 16.\n\nTotal Sleep Deprivation and Pain Perception during Cold Noxious Stimuli in \nHumans.\n\nLarson RA(1), Carter JR(1).\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Department of Kinesiology and Integrative Physiology, Michigan Technological \nUniversity, Houghton, MI, United States.\n\nBACKGROUND AND AIMS: A substantial portion of the population suffers from \nchronic pain leading to significant health care costs and lost productivity. \nLoss of sleep duration and quality are widely reported in patients suffering \nfrom a variety of acute or chronic pain conditions. Conversely, sleep loss has \nbeen known to elevate pain perception; thus a potential bi-directional \nrelationship exists between sleep deprivation and pain. To date, the majority of \nstudies examining the relationship between experimentally induced pain and sleep \nloss have focused on the measurement of pain threshold. Additionally, despite \nevidence of sex differences in ratings of perceived pain, previous studies \nexamining pain following sleep loss have not probed for sex differences. We \nexamined the effects of 24-hour total sleep deprivation (TSD) on perceived pain \nduring a 2-minute cold pressor test (CPT). We hypothesized that TSD would \naugment perceived pain and that women would demonstrate an elevated pain \nresponse compared to men.\nMETHODS: Testing was carried out in 14 men and 13 women. All subjects reported \nto be nonsmokers with no history of cardiovascular disease, autonomic \ndysfunction, asthma, or diabetes. All female subjects were free of oral \ncontraceptive use, and were tested during the early follicular phase of the \nmenstrual cycle. Trial order was randomized and testing sessions (Normal sleep \n(NS) and TSD) were separated by approximately one month. Subjects immersed their \nleft hand, up to the wrist, in an ice water bath (~1\u00b0C), and perceived pain was \nrecorded every 15 seconds from a modified Borg scale (6-20 arbitrary units \na.u.).\nRESULTS: Perceived pain responses during CPT were augmented following TSD (\u03941.2 \na.u.; time \u00d7 condition, p<0.05). The augmented pain response following TSD was \nnoted when perceived pain was expressed as mean (NS \u03947.0\u00b10.5 vs. TSD \u03948.2\u00b10.5 \na.u.; p<0.05) or peak (NS \u03948.9\u00b10.6 vs. TSD \u039410.2\u00b10.5 a.u.; p<0.05) perceived \npain. The effects of TSD on perceived pain were similar in both men and women \n(condition \u00d7 time \u00d7 sex, p>0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that TSD significantly augments \nperceived pain during CPT, but this response was not sex dependent. These \nfindings support emerging evidence that adequate sleep represents a relevant, \nand cost effective, preventative\/therapeutic strategy to reduce self-perceived \npain in both men and women.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.sjpain.2016.05.037\nPMCID: PMC5111796\nPMID: 27867438 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

A key assumption about the benefits of cold water immersion \nis that it reduces inflammation in skeletal muscle. However, no data are \navailable from humans to support this notion. We compared the effects of cold \nwater immersion and active recovery on inflammatory and cellular stress \nresponses in skeletal muscle from exercise-trained men 2, 24 and 48\u00a0h during \nrecovery after acute resistance exercise. Exercise led to the infiltration of \ninflammatory cells, with increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines \nand neurotrophins, and the subcellular translocation of heat shock proteins in \nmuscle. These responses did not differ significantly between cold water \nimmersion and active recovery. Our results suggest that cold water immersion is \nno more effective than active recovery for minimizing the inflammatory and \nstress responses in muscle after resistance exercise.\nABSTRACT: Cold water immersion and active recovery are common post-exercise \nrecovery treatments. However, little is known about whether these treatments \ninfluence inflammation and cellular stress in human skeletal muscle after \nexercise. We compared the effects of cold water immersion versus active recovery \non inflammatory cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophins and heat shock \nproteins (HSPs) in skeletal muscle after intense resistance exercise. Nine \nactive men performed unilateral lower-body resistance exercise on separate days, \nat least 1\u00a0week apart. On one day, they immersed their lower body in cold water \n(10\u00b0C) for 10\u00a0min after exercise. On the other day, they cycled at a low \nintensity for 10\u00a0min after exercise. Muscle biopsies were collected from the \nexercised leg before, 2, 24 and 48\u00a0h after exercise in both trials. Exercise \nincreased intramuscular neutrophil and macrophage counts, MAC1 and CD163 mRNA \nexpression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Exercise also increased IL1\u03b2, TNF, IL6, CCL2, CCL4, \nCXCL2, IL8 and LIF mRNA expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). As evidence of hyperalgesia, the \nexpression of NGF and GDNF mRNA increased after exercise (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The \ncytosolic protein content of \u03b1B-crystallin and HSP70 decreased after exercise \n(P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This response was accompanied by increases in the cytoskeletal \nprotein content of \u03b1B-crystallin and the percentage of type II fibres stained \nfor \u03b1B-crystallin. Changes in inflammatory cells, cytokines, neurotrophins and \nHSPs did not differ significantly between the recovery treatments. These \nfindings indicate that cold water immersion is no more effective than active \nrecovery for reducing inflammation or cellular stress in muscle after a bout of \nresistance exercise.\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Authors.

W.Gregson@ljmu.ac.uk.\n\nPURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that both post-exercise and passive cold water \nimmersion (CWI) increases PGC-1\u03b1 and VEGF mRNA expression in human skeletal \nmuscle.\nMETHOD: Study 1 Nine males completed an intermittent running protocol (8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03-min \nbouts at 90\u00a0% [Formula: see text], interspersed with 3-min active recovery \n(1.5-min at 25\u00a0% and 1.5-min at 50\u00a0% [Formula: see text]) before undergoing CWI \n(10\u00a0min at 8\u00a0\u00b0C) or seated rest (CONT) in a counterbalanced, randomised manner. \nStudy 2 Ten males underwent an identical CWI protocol under passive conditions.\nRESULTS: Study 1 PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA increased in CONT (~3.4-fold; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and CWI \n(~5.9-fold; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at 3\u00a0h post-exercise with a greater increase observed in \nCWI (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). VEGFtotal mRNA increased after CWI only (~2.4-fold) compared \nwith CONT (~1.1-fold) at 3\u00a0h post-exercise (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Study 2 Following CWI, \nPGC-1\u03b1 mRNA expression was significantly increased ~1.3-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and \n1.4-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) at 3 and 6\u00a0h, respectively. Similarly, VEGF165 mRNA was \nsignificantly increased in CWI ~1.9-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and 2.2-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) at \n3 and 6\u00a0h post-immersion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Data confirm post-exercise CWI augments the acute exercise-induced \nexpression of PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA in human skeletal muscle compared to exercise per se. \nAdditionally CWI per se mediates the activation of PGC-1\u03b1 and VEGF mRNA \nexpression in human skeletal muscle.

The stress induced increase in \nblood pressure recovers within very short period of time and those with \nexaggerated stress induced cardiovascular response at young age have a high risk \nof blood pressure elevation in future. Objective To determine the cardiovascular \nreactivity in response to cold and to correlate its relation with factors such \nas smoking, family history and physical activity. Method Study was conducted in \nthe Department of Pharmacy, Kathmandu University from July to November, 2015. \nResting blood pressure was recorded using sphygmomanometer in sitting position \nafter 5 minutes of rest. Out of 130 volunteers, 34 were found to be \nprehypertensive and equal number of normotensive were recruited randomly to \nperform the test. The subjects were directed to immerse his\/her right hand up to \nthe wrist in cold water of 10\u02daC for 1 minute. The blood pressure was recorded \njust before the hand was taken out of the water and then 1.5 minutes and 4 \nminutes after the withdrawal. Data was analyzed by Student's t test using \nMicrosoft Excel 2007. Result Systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased \nsignificantly after cold pressor test in both normal (systolic blood pressure \nfrom 110\u00b16.46 to 119\u00b19.45 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure from 71\u00b14.63 to \n78\u00b16.15 mmHg) and prehypertensive group (systolic blood pressure from 122\u00b16.75 \nto 126\u00b18.05 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure from 79\u00b16.78 to 85\u00b17.76 mmHg). \nMaximum recovery in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in \n2.5 minutes of removal of hand from cold water. Though sharp drop was observed \nin blood pressure at the end of 2.5 minute in both groups of individuals, the \nrecovery in case of prehypertensive individual was not sharper. In the present \nstudy, significant rise in diastolic blood pressure was observed in \nprehypertensive smoking males. Also the difference was significant (p<0.02) in \nrecovery of diastolic blood pressure between smoker and non smoker \nprehypertensive group. Conclusion This study suggests that prolonged elevation \nin blood pressure in response to stress in young individual can be used as \nmarker of development of hypertension in future. Adopting a healthier lifestyle \ncan help to delay the development of hypertension in later life.\n\nPMID: 29336422 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Treatments were reversed in the second \nsession (after 1 week).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine \naminotransferase enzymes; perceived muscle soreness; and recovery through visual \nanalogue scales and muscle power of the upper and lower limbs at pretraining, \npostrecovery, 24 hours, and 48 hours.\nRESULTS: Athletes who underwent CWI showed better posttraining recovery measures \nbecause circulating LDH levels were lower at 24 hours postrecovery in the CWI \ncondition (441.9 \u00b1 81.4 IU\/L) than in the control condition (493.6 \u00b1 97.4 IU\/L; \nP = .03). Estimated muscle power was higher in the CWI than in the control \ncondition for both upper limbs (757.9 \u00b1 125.1 W versus 695.9 \u00b1 56.1 W) and lower \nlimbs (53.7 \u00b1 3.7 cm versus 35.5 \u00b1 8.2 cm; both P values = .001). In addition, \nwe observed less perceived muscle soreness (1.5 \u00b1 1.1 arbitrary units [au] \nversus 3.1 \u00b1 1.0 au; P = .004) and higher perceived recovery (8.8 \u00b1 1.9 au \nversus 6.9 \u00b1 1.7 au; P = .005) in the CWI than in the control condition at 24 \nhours postrecovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of CWI can be beneficial to jiu-jitsu athletes because it \nreduces circulating LDH levels, results in less perceived muscle soreness, and \nhelps muscle power recovery at 24 hours postrecovery.\n\nDOI: 10.4085\/1062-6050-51.9.01\nPMCID: PMC5317190\nPMID: 27575565 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Pain response was measured using \nthe Cold-Pressor Test (CPT). Participants immersed their hand in cold water \n(4\u00b0C); times to report pain (pain sensitivity) and withdraw the hand (pain \ntolerance) were recorded. Subjective drug ratings were also measured.\nRESULTS: Among men, active cannabis significantly decreased pain sensitivity \nrelative to inactive cannabis (p<0.01). In women, active cannabis failed to \ndecrease pain sensitivity relative to inactive. Active cannabis increased pain \ntolerance in both men women immediately after smoking (p<0.001); a trend was \nobserved for differences between men and women (p<0.10). Active cannabis also \nincreased subjective ratings of cannabis associated with abuse liability ('Take \nagain,' 'Liking,' 'Good drug effect'), drug strength, and 'High' relative to \ninactive in both men and women (p<0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in cannabis smokers, men exhibit \ngreater cannabis-induced analgesia relative to women. These sex-dependent \ndifferences are independent of cannabis-elicited subjective effects associated \nwith abuse-liability, which were consistent between men and women. As such, \nsex-dependent differences in cannabis's analgesic effects are an important \nconsideration that warrants further investigation when considering the potential \ntherapeutic effects of cannabinoids for pain relief.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This \nstudy was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of IM and CMI on tissue \ntemperature and potential benefit to preventing DOMS. The research encompassed \n36 subjects divided into three groups of twelve depending on the form of \nrecovery: ice massage (IM), cold-water immersion (CWI), or passive recovery \n(PAS). All the participants were asked to jump as high as possible from a full \nsquat for one minute. Thermal imaging was conducted at rest, immediately \nfollowing the exercise, immediately after the trial, following the recovery \ntreatment, and after 30min of rest. Their pain levels were assessed using the \nVisual Analogue Scale (VAS). After applying the selected method for supporting \nrecovery, the LA level decreased by 4.25mmol\/L in the IM group, and by \n4.96mmol\/L in the CWI group (IM vs. CWI p>0.05). The 2.75mmol\/L decrease in \nlactate concentration in the PAS group was significantly lower than in the other \ngroups (IM vs. PAS p<0.05\/ CWI vs. PAS p<0.01). In both groups, Tsk after 30min \nwas significantly lower (\u0394Tsk~0.5\u00b0C) than at rest (p<0.05). In turn, Tsk in the \nPAS group returned to the resting values (p>0.05). Seventy-two hours after the \nexercise, a clear decrease in discomfort was observed in the IM and CWI groups \ncompared to the PAS group. The two applied treatments have proven to be \neffective both in utilizing lactate and preventing DOMS. Depending on training \nrequirements, we recommend the use of IM when athletes experience localized \nmuscle fatigue. One the other hand, CWI is recommended in situations of global \nor generalized muscle injury or fatigue.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Soreness was moderately lower 48 h after exercise after CWI (ES \n= -0.68; 90% CI = -1.44 to 0.07). Perception of recovery was moderately enhanced \n24 h after exercise for CWI (ES = -0.62; 90% CI = -1.38 to 0.13). Trivial and \nsmall effects of condition were found for the other outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: CWI was more effective than WBC in accelerating recovery kinetics \nfor countermovement-jump performance at 72 h postexercise. CWI also demonstrated \nlower soreness and higher perceived recovery levels across 24-48 h postexercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2016-0186\nPMID: 27396361 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Nineteen male subjects were divided into two experiments \n(protocol 1, n = 10 and protocol 2, n = 9). In protocol 1, subjects performed \ncycle exercise at 50% peak oxygen uptake in the heat (37\u00b0C and 50% RH) in the \nmorning (0600) and evening (1800). Results showed that baseline resting and \nexercising esophageal temperature (Tes) were significantly (0.5\u00b0C) higher in the \nevening than morning. Minute ventilation (V\u0307e) increased from 54.3 \u00b1 7.9 and \n54.9 \u00b1 6.8 l\/min at 10 min to 71.4 \u00b1 8.1 and 76.5 \u00b1 11.8 l\/min at 48.5 min in \nthe morning and evening, respectively (both P < 0.01). Time of day had no effect \non V\u0307e (P = 0.44). When V\u0307e as the output response was plotted against Tes as \nthermal input, the Tes threshold for increases in V\u0307e was higher in the evening \nthan morning (37.2 \u00b1 0.7 vs. 36.6 \u00b1 0.6\u00b0C, P = 0.009), indicating the \nventilatory response to the same core temperature is smaller in the evening. In \nprotocol 2, the circadian rhythm-related higher resting Tes seen in the evening \nwas adjusted down to the same temperature seen in the morning by immersing the \nsubject in cold water. Importantly, the time course of changes in V\u0307e during \nexercise were smaller in the evening, but the threshold for V\u0307e remained higher \nin the evening than morning (P < 0.001). Collectively, those results suggest \nthat time of day has no effect on time course hyperventilation during exercise \nin the heat, despite the higher core temperatures in the evening. This is likely \ndue to diurnal variation in the control of ventilation in response to rising \ncore temperature.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 the American Physiological Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/ajpregu.00484.2015\nPMCID: PMC5008665\nPMID: 27335282 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The current recommended treatment of EHS is \ncold-water immersion; however, limitations may require the use of alternative \nresources such as a cold shower (CS) or dousing with a hose to cool EHS \npatients.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the cooling effectiveness of a CS after \nexercise-induced hyperthermia.\nDESIGN: Randomized, crossover controlled study.\nSETTING: Environmental chamber (temperature = 33.4\u00b0C \u00b1 2.1\u00b0C; relative humidity \n= 27.1% \u00b1 1.4%).\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen participants (10 male, 7 female; \nheight = 1.75 \u00b1 0.07 m, body mass = 70.4 \u00b1 8.7 kg, body surface area = 1.85 \u00b1 \n0.13 m(2), age range = 19-35 years) volunteered.\nINTERVENTION(S): On 2 occasions, participants completed matched-intensity \nvolitional exercise on an ergometer or treadmill to elevate rectal temperature \nto \u226539\u00b0C or until participant fatigue prevented continuation (reaching at least \n38.5\u00b0C). They were then either treated with a CS (20.8\u00b0C \u00b1 0.80\u00b0C) or seated in \nthe chamber (control [CON] condition) for 15 minutes.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rectal temperature, calculated cooling rate, heart \nrate, and perceptual measures (thermal sensation and perceived muscle pain).\nRESULTS: The rectal temperature (P = .98), heart rate (P = .85), thermal \nsensation (P = .69), and muscle pain (P = .31) were not different during \nexercise for the CS and CON trials (P > .05). Overall, the cooling rate was \nfaster during CS (0.07\u00b0C\/min \u00b1 0.03\u00b0C\/min) than during CON (0.04\u00b0C\/min \u00b1 \n0.03\u00b0C\/min; t16 = 2.77, P = .01). Heart-rate changes were greater during CS (45 \n\u00b1 20 beats per minute) compared with CON (27 \u00b1 10 beats per minute; t16 = 3.32, \nP = .004). Thermal sensation was reduced to a greater extent with CS than with \nCON (F3,45 = 41.12, P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the CS facilitated cooling rates faster than no treatment, \nclinicians should continue to advocate for accepted cooling modalities and use \nCS only if no other validated means of cooling are available.\n\nDOI: 10.4085\/1062-6050-51.4.01\nPMCID: PMC4852530\nPMID: 26942657 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This study tested the hypothesis that \npulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressures are higher in \nSIPE-susceptible individuals during submerged exercise than in the general \npopulation and are reduced by sildenafil.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Ten study subjects with a history of SIPE (mean age, 41.6 \nyears) and 20 control subjects (mean age, 36.2 years) were instrumented with \nradial artery and pulmonary artery catheters and performed moderate cycle \nergometer exercise for 6 to 7 minutes while submersed in 20\u00b0C water. \nSIPE-susceptible subjects repeated the exercise 150 minutes after oral \nadministration of 50 mg sildenafil. Work rate and mean arterial pressure during \nexercise were similar in controls and SIPE-susceptible subjects. Average o2 and \ncardiac output in controls and SIPE-susceptible subjects were: o2 2.42 L\u00b7min(-1) \nversus 1.95 L\u00b7min(-1), P=0.2; and cardiac output 17.9 L\u00b7min(-1) versus 13.8 \nL\u00b7min(-1), P=0.01. Accounting for differences in cardiac output between groups, \nmean pulmonary artery pressure at cardiac output=13.8 L\u00b7min(-1) was 22.5 mm Hg \nin controls versus 34.0 mm Hg in SIPE-susceptible subjects (P=0.004), and the \ncorresponding pulmonary artery wedge pressure was 11.0 mm Hg versus 18.8 mm Hg \n(P=0.028). After sildenafil, there were no statistically significant differences \nin mean pulmonary artery pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure between \nSIPE-susceptible subjects and controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: These observations confirm that SIPE is a form of hemodynamic \npulmonary edema. The reduction in pulmonary vascular pressures after sildenafil \nwith no adverse effect on exercise hemodynamics suggests that it may be useful \nin SIPE prevention.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Additionally, increased translational \ncapacity via elevated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis has also been implicated in \nresistance training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The time course of \nribosome biogenesis following resistance exercise (RE) and the impact exerted by \ndiffering recovery strategies remains unknown. In the present study, the \nactivation of transcriptional regulators, the expression levels of pre-rRNA, and \nmature rRNA components were measured through 48\u00a0h after a single-bout RE. In \naddition, the effects of either low-intensity cycling (active recovery, ACT) or \na cold-water immersion (CWI) recovery strategy were compared. Nine male subjects \nperformed two bouts of high-load RE randomized to be followed by 10\u00a0min of \neither ACT or CWI. Muscle biopsies were collected before RE and at 2, 24, and \n48\u00a0h after RE. RE increased the phosphorylation of the p38-MNK1-eIF4E axis, an \neffect only evident with ACT recovery. Downstream, cyclin D1 protein, total \neIF4E, upstream binding factor 1 (UBF1), and c-Myc proteins were all increased \nonly after RE with ACT. This corresponded with elevated abundance of the \npre-rRNAs (45S, ITS-28S, ITS-5.8S, and ETS-18S) from 24\u00a0h after RE with ACT. In \nconclusion, coordinated upstream signaling and activation of transcriptional \nfactors stimulated pre-rRNA expression after RE. CWI, as a recovery strategy, \nmarkedly blunted these events, suggesting that suppressed ribosome biogenesis \nmay be one factor contributing to the impaired hypertrophic response observed \nwhen CWI is used regularly after exercise.\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Given the effects of cold water \nimmersion on blood flow, evaluating in vivo changes in tissue oxygenation during \ncold water immersion may help further our understanding of this recovery \nmodality. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cold water immersion on \nmuscle oxygenation and performance during repeated bouts of fatiguing exercise \nin a group of healthy young adults. Twenty healthy subjects performed 2 \nfatiguing bouts of maximal dynamic knee extension and flexion contractions both \nconcentrically on an isokinetic dynamometer with a 10-min recovery period in \nbetween. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a cold water immersion \n(treatment) or passive recovery (control) group. Changes in muscle oxygenation \nwere monitored continuously using near-infrared spectroscopy. Muscle performance \nwas measured with isokinetic dynamometry during each fatiguing bout. Skin \ntemperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle soreness ratings were also \nassessed. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis was used to evaluate treatment \neffects. The treatment group had a significantly lower mean heart rate and lower \nskin temperature compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Cold water immersion \nattenuated a reduction in tissue oxygenation in the second fatiguing bout by 4% \nwhen compared with control. Muscle soreness was rated lower 1 day post-testing \n(P < 0.05). However, cold water immersion had no significant effect on muscle \nperformance in subsequent exercise.

RS performance was \ncalculated as time taken (s) to complete 6 \u00d7 30-m sprints within the first half \nof each match.\nRESULTS: There were large increases in postintervention ln rMSSD between CWI and \nPAS after all matches (ES 90% CL: +1.13; \u00b10.21). Average heart rate (HR) during \nthe RS performance task (HRAverage RS) was impaired from baseline from match 3 \nonward for both conditions. However, HRAverage RS was higher with CWI than with \nPAS (ES 90% CL: 0.58; \u00b10.58). Peak HR during the RS performance task (HRPeak RS) \nwas similarly impaired from baseline for match 3 onward during PAS and for match \n4 onward with CWI. HRPeak RS was very likely higher with CWI than with PAS (ES \n90% CL: +0.80; \u00b10.56). No effects of match or condition were observed for RS \nperformance, although there were moderate correlations between the changes in \nHRAverage RS (r 90% CL: -0.33; \u00b10.14), HRPeak RS (r 90% CL: -0.38; \u00b10.13), and \nRS performance.\nCONCLUSION: CWI facilitated cardiac parasympathetic reactivation after a \nsimulated rugby sevens match. The decline in average and peak HR across matches \nwas partially attenuated by CWI. This decline was moderately correlated with a \nreduction in RS performance.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2015-0317\nPMID: 26356254 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the \nCWI group (P < 0.05). Isokinetic work (19%), type II muscle fibre \ncross-sectional area (17%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26%) increased \nin the ACT group (all P < 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine \nactive men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, \nfollowed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h \nafter exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion \nmolecule (NCAM) (10-30%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50%) increased 24-48 \nh after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h \nafter exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers \nwere greater after ACT than after CWI (P < 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 \nkinase(Thr421\/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was \ngreater after ACT (P < 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute \nchanges in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle \nhypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle \nstrength and hypertrophy.

Cardiac output was measured non-invasively with an inert gas rebreathing \nmethod prior to and immediately after the first sauna exposure and after \ncold-water immersion, respectively. Blood pressure was measured before, twice \nduring and after sauna. The autonomic nervous system was assessed by power \nspectral analysis of heart rate variability. Total power, low-frequency and \nhigh-frequency components were evaluated. The low frequency\/high frequency ratio \nwas used as a marker of sympathovagal balance. Sauna and cold-water immersion \nwere well tolerated by all subjects.\nRESULTS: Cardiac output and heart rate significantly increased in all groups \nafter sauna and cold-water immersion (p\u2009<\u20090.05), except for coronary artery \ndisease patients after sauna exposure. Systolic blood pressure during sauna \ndecreased significantly in all groups with a nadir after 6\u2009min (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). \nCold-water immersion significantly increased systolic blood pressure in all \ngroups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). No change in the low\/high frequency ratio was found in \nchronic heart failure patients. In coronary artery disease patients and controls \na prolonged increase in low frequency\/high frequency ratio was observed after \nthe first sauna exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to Finnish sauna and cold-water immersion causes \nhaemodynamic alterations in chronic heart failure patients similarly to control \nsubjects and in particular did not provoke an excessive increase in adrenergic \nactivity or complex arrhythmias.\n\n\u00a9 The European Society of Cardiology 2015.\n\nDOI: 10.1177\/2047487315594506\nPMID: 26152773 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Dr Thain is now at Faculty of Health and Social \nSciences, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom.\n\nCONTEXT: Cryotherapy is used widely in sport and exercise medicine to manage \nacute injuries and facilitate rehabilitation. The analgesic effects of \ncryotherapy are well established; however, a potential caveat is that cooling \ntissue negatively affects neuromuscular control through delayed muscle reaction \ntime. This topic is important to investigate because athletes often return to \nexercise, rehabilitation, or competitive activity immediately or shortly after \ncryotherapy.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of wet-ice application, cold-water immersion, \nand an untreated control condition on peroneus longus and tibialis anterior \nmuscle reaction time during a simulated lateral ankle sprain.\nDESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial.\nSETTING: University of Hertfordshire human performance laboratory.\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 54 physically active individuals (age \n= 20.1 \u00b1 1.5 years, height = 1.7 \u00b1 0.07 m, mass = 66.7 \u00b1 5.4 kg) who had no \ninjury or history of ankle sprain.\nINTERVENTION(S): Wet-ice application, cold-water immersion, or an untreated \ncontrol condition applied to the ankle for 10 minutes.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Muscle reaction time and muscle amplitude of the \nperoneus longus and tibialis anterior in response to a simulated lateral ankle \nsprain were calculated. The ankle-sprain simulation incorporated a combined \ninversion and plantar-flexion movement.\nRESULTS: We observed no change in muscle reaction time or muscle amplitude after \ncryotherapy for either the peroneus longus or tibialis anterior (P > .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Ten minutes of joint cooling did not adversely affect muscle \nreaction time or muscle amplitude in response to a simulated lateral ankle \nsprain. These findings suggested that athletes can safely return to sporting \nactivity immediately after icing. Further evidence showed that ice can be \napplied before ankle rehabilitation without adversely affecting dynamic \nneuromuscular control. Investigation in patients with acute ankle sprains is \nwarranted to assess the clinical applicability of these interventions.\n\nDOI: 10.4085\/1062-6050-50.4.05\nPMCID: PMC4532180\nPMID: 26067429 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, the physiological effects of CWI and \nACT after resistance exercise are not well characterized. We examined the \neffects of CWI and ACT on cardiac output (Q\u0307), muscle oxygenation (SmO2), blood \nvolume (tHb), muscle temperature (Tmuscle), and isometric strength after \nresistance exercise. On separate days, 10 men performed resistance exercise, \nfollowed by 10 min CWI at 10\u00b0C or 10 min ACT (low-intensity cycling). Q\u0307 (7.9 \u00b1 \n2.7 l) and Tmuscle (2.2 \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C) increased, whereas SmO2 (-21.5 \u00b1 8.8%) and tHb \n(-10.1 \u00b1 7.7 \u03bcM) decreased after exercise (P < 0.05). During CWI, Q\u0307 (-1.1 \u00b1 0.7 \nl) and Tmuscle (-6.6 \u00b1 5.3\u00b0C) decreased, while tHb (121 \u00b1 77 \u03bcM) increased (P < \n0.05). In the hour after CWI, Q\u0307 and Tmuscle remained low, while tHb also \ndecreased (P < 0.05). By contrast, during ACT, Q\u0307 (3.9 \u00b1 2.3 l), Tmuscle (2.2 \u00b1 \n0.5\u00b0C), SmO2 (17.1 \u00b1 5.7%), and tHb (91 \u00b1 66 \u03bcM) all increased (P < 0.05). In \nthe hour after ACT, Tmuscle, and tHb remained high (P < 0.05). Peak isometric \nstrength during 10-s maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) did not change \nsignificantly after CWI, whereas it decreased after ACT (-30 to -45 Nm; P < \n0.05). Muscle deoxygenation time during MVCs increased after ACT (P < 0.05), but \nnot after CWI. Muscle reoxygenation time after MVCs tended to increase after CWI \n(P = 0.052). These findings suggest first that hemodynamics and muscle \ntemperature after resistance exercise are dependent on ambient temperature and \nmetabolic demands with skeletal muscle, and second, that recovery of strength \nafter resistance exercise is independent of changes in hemodynamics and muscle \ntemperature.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 the American Physiological Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/ajpregu.00151.2015\nPMID: 26062633 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We found that rectal temperature was elevated above \nbaseline (P\u2009<\u20090.05) at the end of all delay periods (5\u2009min: 40.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32; \n20\u2009min: 39.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40; 40\u2009min: 39.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29\u2009\u00b0C).

Unfortunately, direct evidence linking empathy for \npain and descending inhibitory controls (conditioned pain modulation) is \nlacking. This study, therefore, aimed to determine if the observation of \nourselves or a loved-one in pain could activate descending pain inhibition \nwithout exposure to a noxious stimulation; which is otherwise required.\nMETHODS: Descending pain inhibition was triggered by immersing the right arm of \nparticipants (15 heterosexual couples; mean age\u00b1SE: 28.89\u00b12.14) in a bath of \ncold water. The effects of empathy on descending pain inhibition were observed \nby immersing the right arm of participants in a bath of lukewarm water while \nhaving them watch a video of either themselves or their spouse during a previous \nnociceptive immersion. Immersion of the arm in a bath of lukewarm water without \nempathic (video) observation was also included as a control condition.\nRESULTS: A strong inhibitory response activated by the mere observation of the \nvideo of themselves or their spouse in pain without a nociceptive conditioning \nstimulus. Associative statistics also showed that strong pain catastrophizing \nresponses while watching the video resulted in stronger pain inhibition. \nMoreover, high levels of empathy were associated with stronger pain inhibition, \nbut only for women.\nDISCUSSION: This study showed that observing someone in pain triggers descending \npain inhibition.

The main aim of this study was to compare physiological and \npsychological reactions between people who exhibited fast cooling (FC; n = 20) \nor slow cooling (SC; n = 20) responses to cold water immersion. Individuals in \nwhom the T(re) decreased to a set point of 35.5 \u00b0C before the end of the 170-min \ncooling time were indicated as the FC group; individuals in whom the T(re) did \nnot decrease to the set point of 35.5 \u00b0C before the end of the 170-min cooling \ntime were classified as the SC group. Cold stress was induced using intermittent \nimmersion in bath water at 14 \u00b0C. Motor (spinal and supraspinal reflexes, \nvoluntary and electrically induced skeletal muscle contraction force) and \ncognitive (executive function, short term memory, short term spatial \nrecognition) performance, immune variables (neutrophils, leucocytes, \nlymphocytes, monocytes, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal \naxis activity (cortisol, corticosterone) and autonomic nervous system activity \n(epinephrine, norepinephrine) were monitored. The data obtained in this study \nsuggest that the response of the FC group to cooling vs the SC group response \nwas more likely an insulative-hypothermic response and that the SC vs the FC \ngroup displayed a metabolic-insulative response. The observations that an \nexposure time to 14 \u00b0C cold water--which was nearly twice as short (96-min vs \n170-min) with a greater rectal temperature decrease (35.5 \u00b0C vs 36.2 \u00b0C) in the \nFC group compared with the SC group--induces similar responses of motor, \ncognitive, and blood stress markers were novel.

Circulating \nmediators of the inflammatory response were measured from EDTA plasma taken \npre-exercise (baseline), immediately post-exercise, and at 2, 24, and 48 h \npost-exercise. Ratings of perceived soreness and impairment were noted on a \n10-pt Likert scale, and squat jump and drop jump were performed at these time \npoints.\nRESULTS: IL-6, IL-8, and MPO increased significantly from baseline immediately \npost-exercise in all conditions. IL-6 remained elevated from baseline at 2 h in \nthe CWI-30 min \u00d7 20 \u00b0C, CWI-10 min \u00d7 10 \u00b0C, and CWI-30 min \u00d7 10 \u00b0C conditions, \nwhile further increases were observed for IL-8 and MPO in the CWI-30 min \u00d7 20 \u00b0C \nand CWI-30 min \u00d7 10 \u00b0C conditions. Squat jump and drop jump height were \nsignificantly lower in all conditions immediately post-exercise and at 2 h. Drop \njump remained below baseline at 24 and 48 h in the CON and CWI-10 min \u00d7 20 \u00b0C \nconditions only, while squat jump height returned to baseline in all conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cold-water immersion appears to facilitate restoration of muscle \nperformance in a stretch-shortening cycle, but not concentric power.

A second 50 m sprint followed after a second 15-minute recovery period \nwith passive immersion in either warm (WI, 30 \u00b0C), or cool water (CI, 26.7 \u00b0C). \nIn a crossover design, all subjects repeated the trial 48 hours later utilizing \nthe alternate immersion temperature. During the 50-m sprints, time and stroke \ncharacteristics were recorded. Blood lactate and heart rates were measured \nbefore and after the trials. Strength and flexibility were recorded before and \nafter immersions and ratings of perceived exertion were evaluated.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in time, event velocity, or \nstroke rate, between any of the trials. With WI, a significant reduction of \nhandgrip strength was observed (P=0.029) with lower ratings of perceived \nexertion observed after the sprint. Higher resting lactate levels were recorded, \nprior to swimming, after both the 15-minute WI and CI water recoveries (P<0.01) \nas compared to NI. No correlation was observed between swim performance times \nand starting or peak lactate levels, with any type of recovery intervention \n(R2=0.047; slope NS from zero).\nCONCLUSION: Recovery by cool (26.7 \u00b0C) or warm (30 \u00b0C) water immersion does not \naffect velocity or stroke characteristics in a 50-m freestyle sprint, even when \nwidely employed performance related determinants such as resting lactate levels \nand perceived exertion are not optimal.\n\nPMID: 25028983 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Rapidly reducing core temperatures will likely increase safety as \nfirefighters are redeployed to subsequent operational tasks. This study \ninvestigated the effectiveness of cold-water immersion (CWI) and iced-slush \ningestion (SLUSH) to cool firefighters post-incident. Seventy-four Australian \nfirefighters (mean \u00b1 SD age: 38.9 \u00b1 9.0 years) undertook a simulated search and \nrescue task in a heat chamber (105 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C). Testing involved two 20-min work \ncycles separated by a 10-min rest period. Ambient temperature during recovery \nperiods was 19.3 \u00b1 2.7 \u00b0C. Participants were randomly assigned one of three \n15-min cooling protocols: (i) CWI, 15 \u00b0C to umbilicus; (ii) SLUSH, 7 g\u00b7kg(-1) \nbody weight; or (iii) seated rest (CONT). Core temperature and strength were \nmeasured pre- and postsimulation and directly after cooling. Mean temperatures \nfor all groups reached 38.9 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b0C at the conclusion of the second work task. \nBoth CWI and SLUSH delivered cooling rates in excess of CONT (0.093 and 0.092 \ncompared with 0.058 \u00b0C\u00b7min(-1)) and reduced temperatures to baseline \nmeasurements within the 15-min cooling period. Grip strength was not negatively \nimpacted by either SLUSH or CONT. CWI and SLUSH provide evidence-based \nalternatives to passive recovery and forearm immersion protocols currently \nadopted by many fire services. To maximise the likelihood of adoption, we \nrecommend SLUSH ingestion as a practical and effective cooling strategy for \npost-incident cooling of firefighters in temperate regions.\n\nDOI: 10.1139\/apnm-2014-0038\nPMID: 25017114 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Thus far, the SECPT has \nbeen administered exclusively to individual participants, which requires \nsubstantial personal effort and time. Therefore, the aim of the present study \nwas to investigate whether and to what extent cardiovascular parameters (SNS) \nand salivary cortisol concentrations (HPA axis) are affected over the course of \nrepeated SECPT administration in a group design. The SECPT was conducted in \ngroups of seven or more persons and repeated twice with a 24-h interval between \neach administration. During the stress test, the participants (n=61) were \nvideotaped and observed continuously while they immersed their hands into \nice-cold (1 \u00b0C, experimental group) or room-temperature (20 \u00b0C, control group) \nwater. Blood pressure, heart rate, salivary cortisol concentration, and \nsubjective stress perception were measured. All of these parameters increased \nsignificantly during each of the three stress exposures; in contrast, they \nremained constant in the control group. Moreover, the heart rate response \ntowards the stressor decreased significantly over the course of the repeated \nstress exposures and salivary cortisol concentration of the experimental group \nwas elevated before the third SECPT administration. Our results indicate that \nthe group SECPT activates the SNS and the HPA, leading to increased blood \npressure, heart rate, and cortisol concentration. Moreover, the repeated \nadministration leads to habituation exclusively of heart rate.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system \nattenuates the innate immune response. However, both the autonomic nervous \nsystem and innate immune system are regarded as systems that cannot be \nvoluntarily influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program \non the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response. Healthy volunteers \nwere randomized to either the intervention (n = 12) or control group (n = 12). \nSubjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third \neye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by \nbreath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). \nThe control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent \nexperimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng\/kg Escherichia coli \nendotoxin). In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques \nresulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in \nprofoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, \nplasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly \nafter endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine \nlevels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and \nIL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 \nlevels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. In \nconclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous \nsystem results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate \nimmune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important \nimplications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or \npersistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1073\/pnas.1322174111\nPMCID: PMC4034215\nPMID: 24799686 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

This study \nexamined the physiological merit of CWI for recovery from high-intensity \nexercise by investigating if the placebo effect is responsible for any acute \nperformance or psychological benefits.\nMETHODS: Thirty males (mean \u00b1 SD: age, 24 \u00b1 5 yr; VO2 peak, 51.1 \u00b1 7.0 mL \u00b7 \nkg(-1) \u00b7 min(-1)) performed an acute high-intensity interval training session, \ncomprised of 4 \u00d7 30-s sprints, immediately followed by one of the following \nthree 15-min recovery conditions: CWI (10.3\u00b0C \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C), thermoneutral water \nimmersion placebo (TWP) (34.7\u00b0C \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C), or thermoneutral water immersion \ncontrol (TWI) (34.7\u00b0C \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C). An intramuscular thermistor was inserted during \nexercise and recovery to record muscle temperature. Swelling (thigh girth), pain \nthreshold\/tolerance, interleukin 6 concentration, and total leukocyte, \nneutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were recorded at baseline, postexercise, \npostrecovery, and 1, 24, and 48 h postexercise. A maximal voluntary isometric \ncontraction (MVC) of the quadriceps was performed at the same time points, with \nthe exception of postexercise. Self-assessments of readiness for exercise, \nfatigue, vigor, sleepiness, pain, and belief of recovery effectiveness were also \ncompleted.\nRESULTS: Leg strength after the MVC and ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, \nand vigor were significantly impaired in TWI compared with those in CWI and TWP \nwhich were similar to each other.\nCONCLUSIONS: A recovery placebo administered after an acute high-intensity \ninterval training session is superior in the recovery of muscle strength over 48 \nh as compared with TWI and is as effective as CWI. This can be attributed to \nimproved ratings of readiness for exercise, pain, and vigor, suggesting that the \ncommonly hypothesized physiological benefits surrounding CWI are at least partly \nplacebo related.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0000000000000348\nPMID: 24674975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The tests were conducted in a counterbalanced order \nand separated by a 1-hour interval. Throughout the 30-min cold-water immersion \n(CWI) and the 15-min spontaneous rewarming (RW) phases, finger-skin temperatures \nwere measured continuously with thermocouple probes; infrared thermography was \nalso employed during the RW phase to map all segments of the hand. During the \nCWI phase, the average skin temperature (Tavg) of the fingers did not differ \nbetween the conditions (AIR: 10.2 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C, HYPO: 10.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C; p = 0.67). \nHowever, Tavg was lower in the HYPO than the AIR RW phase (AIR: 24.5 \u00b1 3.4\u00b0C; \nHYPO: 22.0 \u00b1 3.8\u00b0C; p = 0.002); a response that was alike in all regions of the \nimmersed hand. Accordingly, present findings suggest that acute exposure to \nnormobaric hypoxia does not aggravate the cold-induced drop in hand temperature \nof normothermic males. Still, hypoxia markedly impairs the rewarming responses \nof the hand.\n\nDOI: 10.1089\/ham.2013.1131\nPMCID: PMC4074747\nPMID: 24666109 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Subjects were examined for \nperformance changes in the squat exercise (total repetitions and average power \nper repetition), biomarkers of inflammation, and changes in cross-sectional area \nand echo intensity (EI) of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis muscles.\nRESULTS: No differences between groups were observed in the number of \nrepetitions (P = .250; power: P = .663). Inferential-based analysis indicated \nthat increases in C-reactive protein concentrations were likely increased by a \ngreater magnitude after CWI compared with CON, while NMES possibly decreased \nmore than CON from IP to 24H.

After exercise, subjects immersed \none leg in a cold water bath (10\u00b0C, COLD) to the level of their gluteal fold for \n15 min. The contralateral leg remained outside the water bath and served as \ncontrol (CON). Core body temperature was monitored throughout the experiment, \nwhereas muscle biopsies and muscle temperature (Tm) measurements were obtained \nfrom the vastus lateralis before exercise (PRE), immediately postexercise \n(POST-EX, Tm only), immediately after cooling, and 3 h postexercise (POST-3H).\nRESULTS: Exercise significantly increased core body temperature (PRE, 37.1\u00b0C \u00b1 \n0.4\u00b0C vs POST-EX, 39.3\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C, P < 0.001) and Tm in both CON (PRE, 33.9\u00b0C \u00b1 \n0.7\u00b0C vs POST-EX, 39.1\u00b0C \u00b1 0.5\u00b0C) and COLD legs (PRE, 34.2\u00b0C \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C vs POST-EX, \n39.4\u00b0C \u00b1 0.3\u00b0C), respectively (P < 0.001).

Most of these studies analyzed only short-term recovery effects, \nwhereas the adaptational aspect has been widely neglected. Therefore, we \nanalyzed the effects of repeated cooling after training sessions (CWI) on \nadaptations to strength training. Seventeen trained male students volunteered \nthe study. After a 2-week familiarization period, a pretest (T1) of 1 repetition \nmaximum (RM) and 12RM was conducted followed by the 5-week strength training \nperiod (within-subject design). After the posttest (T2) and a 2-week detraining \nperiod, a retention test (T3) was carried out. Directly after each training \nsession, CWI was applied for 1 randomly assigned leg. Cooling consisted of 3 \n4-minute intervals with a 30-second rest period. The other leg was not cooled. A \nsignificant increase in 1RM and 12RM from baseline to T2 and T3 (p < 0.001), \nrespectively, and a further significant increase in 12RM from T2 to T3 (p \u2264 \n0.05) were observed. In addition, a tendency for a large leg effect with higher \nvalues for the \"control leg\" in both parameters (p = 0.08 each) and a moderate \ntime \u00d7 leg interaction in favor of the control leg was found (1RM: p = 0.11; \n12RM: p = 0.09). The percentage change differences between both conditions were \n1.6% for the increase in 1RM from T1 to T2 and 2.0% from T1 to T3 in favor of \nthe control leg. Long-term strength training adaptations in trained subjects can \nbe negatively affected by CWI. However, effects were small, and the practical \nrelevance relative to possible recovery effects needs to be considered in a \nsports practical setting.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0000000000000434\nPMID: 24552795 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Repeated agility, skin \nand core temperature, and perception scales were measured before, immediately \nafter, 5 and 24 hours postexercise. No significant differences in repeated \nagility were evident between conditions at any time point. No significant \ndifferences in core temperature were observed between conditions; however, skin \ntemperature was significantly lower immediately after contrast water therapy and \ncontrast showers compared with the passive condition.

We compared effects of CWI and passive \nrest on cycling performance during a simulated cycling grand tour.\nMETHODS: Thirty-four male endurance-trained competitive cyclists were randomized \nto CWI for four times per week for 15 min at 15\u00b0C or control (passive recovery) \ngroups for 7 d of baseline training, 21 d of intensified training, and an 11-d \ntaper.

Breath-hold PC cine MR images of the coronary sinus \nwere obtained with a 3T MR imager with 32 channel coils at rest and during a CPT \nperformed after immersing one foot in ice water. MBF was calculated as coronary \nsinus flow divided by the left ventricular (LV) mass which was given as a total \nLV myocardial volume measured on cine MRI multiplied by the specific gravity \n(1.05 g\/mL).\nRESULTS: In non-smokers, MBF was 0.86\u00b10.25 mL\/min\/g at rest, with a significant \nincrease to 1.20\u00b10.36 mL\/min\/g seen during CPT (percentage change of MBF (\u2206MBF \n(%)); 39.2%\u00b114.4%, p<0.001). Inter-study reproducibility for \u2206MBF (%) \nmeasurements by different MR technologist was good, as indicated by the \nintraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93 and reproducibility coefficient of \n10.5%. There was no significant difference between smokers and non-smokers for \nresting MBF (0.85\u00b10.32 mL\/min\/g, p=0.91). However, \u2206MBF (%) in smokers was \nsignificantly reduced (-4.0\u00b132.2% vs. 39.2\u00b114.4%, p=0.011).\nCONCLUSION: PC cine MRI can be used to reproducibly quantify MBF response to CPT \nand to detect impaired flow response in smokers. This MR approach may be useful \nfor monitoring the sequential change of coronary blood flow in various \npotentially pathologic conditions and for investigating its relationship with \ncardiovascular risk.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Whole-body DXA scans were undertaken with \nbest practice protocol (Best) or random activity protocol (Random) at baseline, \nafter 3 weeks of overload training, and after a 2-week taper. Magnitudes of \nchanges in total, lean and fat mass from baseline-overload, overload-taper and \nbaseline-taper were assessed by standardization (\u0394mean\/SD).\nRESULTS: The standard deviations of change scores for total and fat-free soft \ntissue mass (FFST) from Random scans (2-3%) were approximately double those \nobserved in the Best (1-2%), owing to extra random errors associated with Random \nscans at baseline. There was little difference in change scores for fat mass. \nThe effect of cold water immersion therapy on baseline-taper changes in FFST was \npossibly harmful (-0.7%; 90% confidence limits \u00b11.2%) with Best scans but \nunclear with Random scans (0.9%; \u00b12.0%).

We aimed to investigate whether this \nperformance effect could be attenuated by combining an active recovery (arm \nexercise) with hip-level CWI, and whether this attenuation may be related to an \neffect on core temperature (Tcore ). Participants (n\u2009=\u20098) completed three \nWingate tests before (Ex1) and after (Ex2) four different 30-min recovery \ninterventions: CWI at 15\u2009\u00b0C (CW15), arm exercise during CWI at 15\u2009\u00b0C (CW15+AE), \narm exercise during thermoneutral immersion at 34\u2009\u00b0C (TW34+AE) and non-immersed \narm exercise (AE). After AE and TW34+AE, performance during Ex2 was not \ndifferent from Ex1; while after CW15+AE and CW15, performance was reduced by \n4.9% and 7.6%, respectively. Arm exercise maintained Tcore during recovery in \nCW15+AE, while it declined to a larger extent upon commencement of Ex2 (-0.9\u2009\u00b0C) \nwhen compared with CW15 (-0.6\u2009\u00b0C). This suggests similar leg muscle cooling \nduring recovery in CW15 and CW15+AE. Without any other significant effects \n(e.g., on blood lactate), these data suggest that the improvement in sprint \nperformance following an active CWI recovery, over CWI alone, may be related to \nmaintained Tcore and its effect on neurophysiological mechanisms that drive \nmuscle activation, but not by reduced muscle cooling.\n\n\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons A\/S.

Between HIIT sessions, they stood in cold water (10 \n\u00b0C) up to their umbilicus, or at room temperature (27 \u00b0C) for 5 min. The natural \nlogarithm of square-root of mean squared differences of successive R-R intervals \n(ln rMSSD) was assessed pre- and post-HIIT1 and HIIT2. Stroke volume (SV), \ncardiac output (Q), O2 uptake (VO2), total muscle hemoglobin (t Hb) and \noxygenation of the vastus lateralis were recorded (using near infrared \nspectroscopy); heart rate, Q, and VO2 on-kinetics (i.e., mean response time, \nMRT), muscle de-oxygenation rate, and anaerobic contribution to exercise were \ncalculated for HIIT1 and HIIT2.\nRESULTS: ln rMSSD was likely higher [between-trial difference (90% confidence \ninterval) [+13.2% (3.3; 24.0)] after CWI compared with PAS. CWI also likely \nincreased SV [+5.9% (-0.1; 12.1)], possibly increased Q [+4.4% (-1.0; 10.3)], \npossibly slowed Q MRT [+18.3% (-4.1; 46.0)], very likely slowed VO2 MRT [+16.5% \n(5.8; 28.4)], and likely increased the anaerobic contribution to exercise [+9.7% \n(-1.7; 22.5)].\nCONCLUSION: CWI between HIIT slowed VO2 on-kinetics, leading to increased \nanaerobic contribution during HIIT2. This detrimental effect of CWI was likely \nrelated to peripheral adjustments, because the slowing of VO2 on-kinetics was \ntwofold greater than that of central delivery of O2 (i.e., Q). CWI has \ndetrimental effects on high-intensity aerobic exercise performance that persist \nfor \u2265 45 min.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-013-2755-z\nPMID: 24158407 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, time to failure (~80\u00a0% [Formula: see \ntext] peak bout) during Ex2 was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) longer in C15 \n(18.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6) than in CT (14.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5), T34 (12.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4) and AR (10.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0); and \nit was also longer (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in CT than AR. Core temperature and heart rate \nwere significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) lower during the initial ~15\u00a0min of Ex2 during C15 \ncompared with all other conditions but they reached similar levels at the end of \nEx2.\nCONCLUSIONS: A 30\u00a0min period of C15 was more beneficial in maintaining intense \nsubmaximal cycling performance than CT, T34 and AR; and CT was also more \nbeneficial than T34 and AR.

This \nstudy extends previous findings by considering the influence of physical \nactivity to maintain buoyancy and subsequent swimming performance.\nMETHODS: Six inexperienced swimmers (three men and three women; mean age 22.8) \nreceived 1 wk of cold-water head-out immersions (10 x 3 min at 15 degrees C) \nalongside mental skills training to improve their treading water technique and \nto control hyperventilation upon immersion. Six inexperienced control swimmers \n(four men and two women; mean age 21.8) received immersions in temperate water \n(27 degrees C). Ventilation, brain blood flow velocity, and blood oxygenation \nwere measured during a physiological test in which participants trod water for \n150 s. In a subsequent simulated survival test, performance (swimming duration \nand distance) and perception of effort were recorded. All the tests were in 10 \ndegrees C water with the head out.\nRESULTS: There were significant improvements in the intervention group's ability \nto suppress rapid increases in respiratory frequency; 62 +\/- 24 breaths x \nmin(-1) to 33 +\/- 12. The drop in brain blood flow was smaller and more \ntransient than that previously reported due to the hypertensive response \nassociated with treading water.\nDISCUSSION: Inexperienced swimmers could benefit from cold-water habituation \ncombined with mental skills training in order to improve voluntary control over \nthe respiratory portion of the cold shock response as part of learning to tread \nwater. This may improve survival prospects in a real-life emergency scenario \nsuch as an overturned boat.\n\nDOI: 10.3357\/asem.3522.2013\nPMID: 23926662 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Forty resistance-trained men (22.3 \u00b1 2.4 yr) were randomized into \nfour groups [placebo (PL), HMB-FA, CWI, and HMB-FA-CWI] and performed an acute, \nintense exercise protocol (four sets of up to 10 repetitions of the squat, dead \nlift, and split squat). Participants also performed four sets of up to 10 \nrepetitions of the squat at 24 and 48 h following the initial exercise bout. \nBlood was sampled before exercise (PRE), immediately postexercise (IP), and 30 \nmin, 24 h, and 48 h postexercise (30P, 24P, and 48P, respectively). Circulating \nTNF-\u03b1 was assayed, and TNFR1 expression on CD14+ monocytes was measured by flow \ncytometry. The exercise protocol significantly elevated TNF-\u03b1 in only PL (P = \n0.006) and CWI (P = 0.045) IP. Mean percent changes show that TNF-\u03b1 \nsignificantly increased from PRE to IP for only PL and CWI groups (P < 0.05), \nwhereas the percent change of TNF-\u03b1 for HMB-FA and HMB-FA-CWI was not \nsignificant. TNFR1 expression was elevated in PL (P = 0.023) and CWI (P = 0.02) \nat 30P compared with PRE, whereas both HMB-FA-treated groups did not increase \nsignificantly. In conclusion, HMB-FA attenuated circulating TNF-\u03b1 IP and TNFR1 \nexpression during recovery compared with PL and CWI. HMB-FA supplementation may \nattenuate the initial immune response to intense exercise, which may reduce \nrecovery time following intense exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.00738.2013\nPMID: 23908318 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

On each study day, all clothing \nconditions were tested in either Cool (20 degrees C) or Cold (8 degrees C) water \nconditions using a randomized balance design. After each trial, subjective \nratings for thermal sensation and exit tasks along with exit task times were \ndetermined.\nRESULTS: Exit task times were unaffected by clothing or water conditions. \nCompared to Control, the Inflated Vest was rated with higher exit task \ndifficulty and impedance, while the Jacket and Overall were not (ratings for \nexit task difficulty and impedance in cold water were: Control, 'a little' and \n'none'; Jacket, 'a little' and 'a little'; Overall, 'a little' and 'moderate'; \nand Inflated Vest, 'moderate' and 'moderate - a lot'). Finally, there was a \ntraining effect, with total exit times improving by 20% from trials 1-8 (12.3 to \n9.8 s).\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that, compared to Control clothing, flotation \nJackets and Overalls do not increase exit time or impede exit during egress from \na submerged vehicle while providing thermoprotection and buoyancy in 20 degrees \nC and 8 degrees C water.

Recovery interventions included a mixture of 15 \nmin CWI, 3 h of wearing full-body CG, and following sleep-hygiene \nrecommendations that night, while the control condition involved postsession \nstretching and no regulation of sleeping patterns. Technical performance (stroke \nand error rates), physical performance (accelerometry, countermovement jump \n[CMJ]), physiological (heart rate, blood lactate), and perceptual (mood, \nexertion, and soreness) measures were recorded from each on-court session, along \nwith sleep quantity each night.\nRESULTS: While stroke and error rates did not differ in the drill session (P > \n.05, d < 0.20), large effects were evident for increased time in play and stroke \nrate in match play after the recovery interventions (P > .05, d > 0.90). \nAlthough accelerometry values did not differ between conditions (P > .05, d < \n0.20), CMJ tended to be improved before match play with recovery (P > .05, d = \n0.90). Furthermore, CWI and CG resulted in faster postsession reductions in \nheart rate and lactate and reduced perceived soreness (P > .05, d > 1.00). In \naddition, sleep-hygiene recommendations increased sleep quantity (P > .05, d > \n2.00) and maintained lower perceived soreness and fatigue (P < .05, d > 2.00).\nCONCLUSIONS: Mixed-method recovery interventions (CWI and CG) used after tennis \nsessions increased ensuing time in play and lower-body power and reduced \nperceived soreness. Furthermore, sleep-hygiene recommendations helped reduce \nperceived soreness.\n\nDOI: 10.1123\/ijspp.2012-0359\nPMID: 23799825 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Healthy male (N=15) and female (N=15) daily marijuana smokers \nparticipated in this outpatient study comparing the analgesic, subjective, and \nphysiological effects of marijuana (0.00, 1.98, or 3.56% THC) to dronabinol (0, \n10, or 20\u2009mg).

Subjective pain and drug effect ratings were also \nmeasured as well as cardiovascular effects. Compared with placebo, marijuana and \ndronabinol decreased pain sensitivity (3.56%; 20\u2009mg), increased pain tolerance \n(1.98%; 20\u2009mg), and decreased subjective ratings of pain intensity (1.98, 3.56%; \n20\u2009mg). The magnitude of peak change in pain sensitivity and tolerance did not \ndiffer between marijuana and dronabinol, although dronabinol produced analgesia \nthat was of a longer duration. Marijuana (1.98, 3.56%) and dronabinol (20\u2009mg) \nalso increased abuse-related subjective ratings relative to placebo; these \nratings were greater with marijuana.

However, the consequences of \nhyper-arousal for visual perception remain unclear. The present study evaluates \nthe impact of hyper-arousal on two aspects of visual sensitivity: visual \nstereoacuity and contrast thresholds. Sixty-eight participants participated in \ntwo experiments. Thirty-four participants were randomly divided into two groups \nin each experiment: Arousal Stimulation or Sham Control. The Arousal Stimulation \ngroup underwent a 50-second cold pressor stimulation (immersing the foot in 0-2\u00b0 \nC water), a technique known to increase arousal. In contrast, the Sham Control \ngroup immersed their foot in room temperature water. Stereoacuity thresholds \n(Experiment 1) and contrast thresholds (Experiment 2) were measured before and \nafter stimulation. The Arousal Stimulation groups demonstrated significantly \nlower stereoacuity and contrast thresholds following cold pressor stimulation, \nwhereas the Sham Control groups showed no difference in thresholds. These \nresults provide the first evidence that hyper-arousal from sensory stimulation \ncan lower visual thresholds.

Hot and cold \nsensory detection thresholds, pain thresholds, pain tolerance and subjective \nratings for a cold (0\u2009\u00b0C) and hot (48\u2009\u00b0C) stimulus were assessed using a 16 \u00d7 16 \nmm thermode (Medoc, Israel) on the forehead and abdomen. Pressure pain \nthresholds were measured on the hand. Cold water immersion tolerance duration \nand subjective ratings were assessed on the hand. Two indices of central pain \nprocessing, i.e., temporal summation and heterotopic noxious stimulation, were \nassessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 20 obese participants [10M\/10F, BMI mean (SD)\u2009=41.5 kg\/m(2) \n(9.4 kg\/m(2) )] and 20 age- and gender-matched non-obese controls [10M\/10F, BMI \nmean (SD)\u2009=23.5 kg\/m(2) (2.9 kg\/m(2) )] were studied.

The \naim was to compare the effects of ice pack and cold-water immersion on the \nmuscular performance parameters of plantar flexors and muscular activation of \nthe triceps surae. 41 healthy men (mean age: 22.1 years, SD: 2.9) were randomly \nassigned to cooling with either ice pack (n=20) or cold-water immersion (n=21). \nIndependent variables were cold modality (ice pack or cold-water immersion) and \npre- and post-cooling measurement time. Dependent variables were muscular \nperformance (measured during isometric and concentric contractions of plantar \nflexors) and electromyography parameters of the triceps surae (median frequency \nand root mean square amplitude). Dependent-samples t-tests were used to compare \npre- and post-cooling data and independent-samples t-tests were used to compare \nthe difference (pre- and post-cooling) between groups. Ice pack increased \nisometric peak torque (mean: 9.00 Nm, P=0.01) and both cold modalities reduced \nmuscular activation in triceps surae (P<0.0001); Cold-water immersion and ice \npack reduced peak torque and total work during dynamic isokinetic contraction at \nboth velocities (mean: -11,00 Nm, P<0.05) and affected muscular activation in \ndifferent ways.

Therefore, we compared NPV derived from an index finger using \ntransmission photoplethysmography as a reference, with NPV derived from a middle \nfinger and four sites of the ear using reflection photoplethysmography during \nbaseline and while performing cold and warm water immersion in ten young and six \nmiddle-aged subjects.

Furthermore, lnNPV reactivities (\u0394lnNPV; the difference \nbetween baseline and test values) from an index finger were significantly \nrelated to \u0394lnNPV from the middle finger and the bottom of the ear-canal (young: \nr = 0.90 and 0.62, middle-aged: r = 0.80 and 0.58, respectively).

Dysfunction is \nassociated with various chronic pain states. Here, the effect of ketamine and \nmorphine on descending inhibition is examined using the conditioned pain \nmodulation (CPM) paradigm in chronic neuropathic pain patients.\nMETHODS: CPM responses were obtained in 10 adult neuropathic pain subjects (two \nmen\/eight women). All subjects had peripheral neuropathy as defined by abnormal \nquantitative sensory testing. The effects of S(+)-ketamine (0.57 mg kg(-1) h(-1) \nfor 1 h) and morphine (0.065 mg kg(-1) h(-1) for 1 h) were tested in a \nrandomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study. CPM was measured at baseline \nand 100 min after the start of treatment and was induced by immersion of the leg \ninto a cold-water bath. The test stimulus was a 30 s static thermal stimulus to \nthe skin of the forearm.\nRESULTS: Without treatment, no CPM was detectable. Treatment with ketamine, \nmorphine, and placebo produced CPM responses of 40.2 (10.9)%, 28.5 (7.0)%, and \n22.1 (12.0)%, respectively (for all treatments, CPM effect P<0.05), with no \nstatistical difference in the magnitude of CPM among treatments. The magnitude \nof CPM correlated positively with the magnitude and duration of spontaneous pain \nrelief.\nCONCLUSIONS: The observed treatment effects in chronic pain patients suggest a \nrole for CPM engagement in analgesic efficacy of ketamine, morphine, and placebo \ntreatment.\n\nDOI: 10.1093\/bja\/aes578\nPMID: 23384733 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

EX comprised cycling for 15 min \nat 75% peak power, then a 15-min maximal time trial. After each condition, a \nfull laboratory-based sleep study (polysomnography) was performed.

Core temperature in EX and CWI \ntrials was higher than CON, until it decreased below that of EX and CON until \nbedtime in CWI. After bedtime, core temperature was similar for all conditions \nthroughout the night, except for a 90-min period where it was lower for CWI than \nEX and CON (3.5-4.5 h postexercise). Heart rates for EX and CWI were both \nsignificantly higher than CON postexercise until bedtime, whereas skin \ntemperature after CWI was significantly lower than EX and CON, remaining lower \nthan EX until 3 h postexercise. Melatonin levels and recovery ratings were \nsimilar between conditions.

Mice treated with ethyl chloride spray, \nisoflurane and buprenorphine, and 2-point local nerve blocks demonstrated \nincreased tail-flick latency compared with that of untreated mice. When we \nevaluated the behavior of adult and preweanling mice after tail biopsy, \nuntreated mice demonstrated behavioral changes immediately after tail biopsy \nthat lasted 30 to 60 min before returning to normal. The use of isoflurane, \nisoflurane and buprenorphine, buprenorphine, 2-point nerve block, or ethyl \nchloride spray in adult mice did not significantly improve their behavioral \nresponse to tail biopsy. Similarly, the use of buprenorphine and ethyl chloride \nspray in preweanling mice did not improve their behavioral response to tail \nbiopsy compared with that of the untreated group. However, immersion in \nbupivacaine for 30 s after tail biopsy decreased tail grooming behavior during \nthe first 30 min after tail biopsy. The anesthetic and analgesic regimens tested \nprovide little benefit in adult and preweanling mice.

The use of \ncold-water immersion (CWI) as a recovery strategy is common; however, the \nphysiological and biochemical rationale behind its use remains unclear. This \nstudy aimed to assess the relationship between body temperature responses to \nwater immersion and individual perception of recovery, with subsequent exercise \nperformance.\nMETHODS: Twelve male rugby players participated in a 3-week cross-over trial \nwhere an intense 60 min conditioning session was followed immediately by 15 min \nof either 14\u00b0C CWI, 30\u00b0C warm-water immersion (WWI) or passive control (CON) \nrecovery intervention. Postexercise body temperatures and subjective ratings of \nthe recovery intervention were recorded and subsequently related to performance \nin a 5\u00d740 m repeated sprint protocol undertaken 24 h later.\nRESULTS: CWI induced large reductions in core body temperature postimmersion \n(effect size (ES) range 1.05-3.21) and improved subsequent sprint performance \ncompared to WWI (ES 1.04\u00b10.84) and CON (ES 1.44\u00b10.84). Both the degree of \ntemperature decrease at 60 min postimmersion (r=0.6948; p=0.0121) and the \nsubjective rating of the recovery intervention (r=0.5886; p=0.0441) were related \nto subsequent sprint performance. A very strong linear correlation was observed \nwhen these two factors were integrated (r=0.7743; p=0.0031).\nCONCLUSION: A combination of physiological and psychological indices provides an \nimproved indication of subsequent performance and suggests an important role of \nindividual perception in enhancing training recovery.\n\nDOI: 10.1136\/bjsports-2012-091647\nPMID: 23293008 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

W.Gregson@ljmu.ac.uk\n\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that postexercise \ncold-water immersion (CWI, via its associated reductions in skeletal muscle \nblood flow) attenuates muscle glycogen resynthesis during short-term recovery \nfrom exhaustive exercise.\nMETHODS: In a repeated-measures design, nine recreationally active men performed \nan exhaustive glycogen depleting cycling protocol (consisting of intermittent \nexercise the night before and steady-state exercise on the subsequent morning of \nthe main trial) followed by 10 min of lower-limb CWI (8\u00b0C) or remained seated in \nnormal ambient conditions (CONT). Subjects were fed carbohydrate (CHO) at an \ningestion rate of 0.6 g\u00b7kg body mass at 30 min postexercise and at 1, 2, and 3 h \npostexercise.\nRESULTS: Reductions in thigh skin temperature and muscle temperature during \npostexercise recovery were greater in CWI compared with CONT (P < 0.01). In \naddition, norepinephrine and blood glucose concentrations were increased and \ndecreased, respectively, during recovery in CWI compared with CONT (P < 0.01). \nPostexercise muscle glycogen (CONT and CWI postexercise = 76 \u00b1 43 and 77 \u00b1 26 \nmmol\u00b7kg dry weight [dw], respectively; mean \u00b1 SD) progressively increased (P < \n0.01) during recovery, although rates of resynthesis did not differ (P = 0.719) \nbetween conditions (CONT and CWI 4 h postexercise = 160 \u00b1 34 and 157 \u00b1 59 \nmmol\u00b7kg dw, respectively). Total glycogen synthesis during recovery was \ncomparable (CONT and CWI = 83 \u00b1 43 and 79 \u00b1 58 mmol\u00b7kg dw, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: Postexercise CWI does not attenuate muscle glycogen resynthesis \nrates during short-term recovery even when CHO availability is considered \nsuboptimal. Athletes who regularly incorporate CWI as a recovery strategy to \nalleviate symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage should therefore not be \nconcerned with potential negative effects of the associated reductions in muscle \nblood flow on the restoration of muscle glycogen stores.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e3182814462\nPMID: 23274601 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This study examined the effect of CWI as a recovery \nstrategy on subsequent running performance in normothermic ambient conditions \n(\u223c22\u00b0C).\nDESIGN: Nine endurance-trained men completed two submaximal exhaustive running \nbouts on three separate occasions. The running bouts (Ex1 and Ex2) were \nseparated by 15min of un-immersed seated rest (CON), hip-level CWI at 8\u00b0C \n(CWI-8) or hip-level CWI at 15\u00b0C (CWI-15).\nMETHODS: Intestinal temperature, blood lactate and heart rate were recorded \nthroughout and V\u02d9O2, running economy and exercise times were recorded during the \nrunning sessions.\nRESULTS: Running time to failure (min) during Ex2 was significantly (p<0.05, \nES=0.7) longer following CWI-8 (27.7\u00b16.3) than CON (23.3\u00b15) but not different \nbetween CWI-15 (26.3\u00b13.4) and CON (p=0.06, ES=0.7) or CWI-8 and CWI-15 (p=0.4, \nES=0.2). Qualitative analyses showed a 95% and 89% likely beneficial effect of \nCWI-8 and CWI-15 during Ex2 compared with CON, respectively. Time to failure \nduring Ex2 was significantly shorter than Ex1 only during the CON condition. \nIntestinal temperature and HR were significantly lower for most of Ex2 during \nCWI-8 and CWI-15 compared with CON but they were similar at failure for the \nthree conditions. Blood lactate, running economy and V\u02d9O2 were not altered by \nCWI.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a 15min period of cold water immersion \napplied between repeated exhaustive exercise bouts significantly reduces \nintestinal temperature and enhances post-immersion running performance in \nnormothermic conditions.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Sports Medicine Australia.

Each \nsequence included one normal wear and two external conditions periods. \nParticipants wore the AP for 7 days under normal conditions or conditions of \ndaily sauna, treadmill, whirlpool or cool water immersion, with a 7-day washout \nbetween treatments. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic \nevaluations.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four subjects completed the study. For EE, the mean maximum \nconcentration level (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from \ntime 0 to 168 h (AUC(0-168)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve \nfrom time 0 to infinity (AUC(0-inf)) were higher during normal conditions \ncompared with all external conditions (geometric means ratio range: 80%-93%), \nexcept cool water. Mean steady-state concentrations (C(ss)) of EE were highest \nunder normal conditions, followed by cool water, sauna, whirlpool and treadmill. \nThe LNG mean C(max), AUC(0-168), AUC(0-inf) and C(ss) were higher under normal \nwear versus all other conditions (geometric means ratios: 75%-82%), with the \nexception of AUC(0-168), AUC(0-inf) and C(ss) for cold water. Median times to \nmaximum concentration (Tmax) for EE and LNG were comparable across conditions. \nPatch adhesion was excellent under all conditions. Adverse events were mild, \nwith none serious or leading to discontinuation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although slightly lower mean drug concentration levels were \nobserved for whirlpool, treadmill and sauna, drug concentrations under all \nconditions were well within therapeutic ranges established for the AP during \nnormal wear and within ranges reported for low-dose combination oral \ncontraceptives.

Skin temperature was significantly \nlower (P<0.05) immediately after WBC compared to CWI. The present study \ndemonstrates that a single WBC exposure decreases muscle and core temperature to \na similar level of those experienced after CWI. Although both treatments \nsignificantly reduced skin temperature, WBC elicited a greater decrease compared \nto CWI.

Plasma cortisol (ng\/ml), heart rate, and blood pressure, as well \nas ratings of stress, pain, and appetite, were serially acquired. An ad libitum \nliquid meal was offered at 45min and intake measured covertly. Fasting cortisol \nwas higher at 15min (mean peak cortisol) following the CPT compared to WW. \nHigher stress was reported at 2 and 15min for the CPT compared to WW. Pain, an \nindirect marker of the acute stress, systolic and diastolic blood pressure \nincreased following the CPT at 2min compared to WW. Hunger decreased after the \nCPT at 2 and 15min, and desire to eat ratings were lower following CPT compared \nto WW. Subjects did not have greater test meal intake (TMI) following CPT \ncompared to WW. There was also no significant relationship between cortisol \nlevels following stress and TMI, indicating that cortisol did not predict \nsubsequent intake in obese women.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, \nclinical studies do not support this, and 5-HT3-antagonists are expected to \nreduce pain by blocking the descending pronociceptive pathway. The current \nproject tested whether tropisetron attenuates analgesia by paracetamol. Two \nrandomized, double-blind, crossover studies with 18 healthy male volunteers in \neach were performed. Pain stimuli were cold water immersion (cold pressor test), \ncontact heat pain (study 1) and electrical stimulation (study 2). In both \nstudies, tropisetron 5\u00a0mg i.v. or saline was administered, followed by \nparacetamol 2\u00a0g i.v. 30\u00a0min. later. Individual changes in heat and cold pain \nintensity, cold pain tolerance and unpleasantness were recorded. The same \nthresholds were also expressed as scores (% of the individual score at \nbaseline). Additionally, previously published findings on the effects of \nparacetamol and its interaction with 5HT3-antagonists in human experimental pain \nmodels were reviewed. After calculation of the sensory and pain scores (%), \ntropisetron seemed to amplify the analgesic action of paracetamol. Paracetamol \n2\u00a0g i.v. did not show any statistically significant analgesia in thermal tests \n(study 1), or differences in sensory, pain detection or moderate pain thresholds \nof the electrical stimulus (study 2). As paracetamol did not have a measurable \nanalgesic effect in these tests, no conclusions can be drawn about the \ninteraction between paracetamol and tropisetron. However, tropisetron may have \nan analgesic effect of its own.

For this study we \nhypothesized that wearing an immersion suit would slow the rate of cooling in \nsubjects who were prewarmed compared to those kept in a normothermic state.\nMETHODS: Two different groups of male subjects (age, 24.7 +\/- 4.2 yr; height, \n183.1 +\/- 6.5 cm; weight, 86.7 +\/- 15.0 kg; body fat, 16.8 +\/- 3.3%) were used \nto gather data under two conditions: prewarming by exercise (Warm-CWI) and \nbaseline (Base-CWI) when wearing a dry immersion suit (2.97 Clo). In Warm-CWI, \nseven subjects rested for 20 min and then cycled on an ergometer cycle for 20 \nmin before immersion in water at 5 degrees C for 140 min. In Base-CWI, six \nsubjects were directly immersed in 5 degrees C water after resting.\nRESULTS: Tre and Tsk were significantly higher after Warm-CWI at start of CWI, \nresulting in faster core cooling rate, and a drop in Tre and Tsk during the \nfirst 10 min. In the long term, the overall core cooling did not differ between \nWarm-CWI (0.34 +\/- 0.11 degrees C x h(-1)) and Base-CWI (0.31 +\/- 0.05 degrees C \nx h(-1)).\nDISCUSSION: Wearing a dry immersion suit eliminates long-term differences in \ncore cooling between prewarmed subjects and those kept in a normothermic state. \nWhen entering cold water with a raised Tre and Tsk, different thermal responses \nduring the first 10 min are expected, but this does not alter long-term core \ncooling.\n\nDOI: 10.3357\/asem.2844.2012\nPMID: 22872987 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Recent \nepidemiological studies identify sleep deprivation as an important risk factor \nfor hypertension, yet the relations between sleep deprivation and cardiovascular \nreactivity remain equivocal. We hypothesized that 24-h total sleep deprivation \n(TSD) would augment cardiovascular reactivity to MS and CPT and blunt the \nMS-induced forearm vasodilation. Because the associations between TSD and \nhypertension appear to be stronger in women, a secondary aim was to probe for \nsex differences. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and muscle \nsympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were recorded during MS and CPT in 28 young, \nhealthy subjects (14 men and 14 women) after normal sleep (NS) and 24-h TSD \n(randomized, crossover design). Forearm vascular conductance (FVC) was recorded \nduring MS. MAP, FVC, and MSNA (n = 10) responses to MS were not different \nbetween NS and TSD (condition \u00d7 time, P > 0.05). Likewise, MAP and MSNA (n = 6) \nresponses to CPT were not different between NS and TSD (condition \u00d7 time, P > \n0.05). In contrast, increases in HR during both MS and CPT were augmented after \nTSD (condition \u00d7 time, P \u2264 0.05), and these augmented HR responses persisted \nduring both recoveries. When analyzed for sex differences, cardiovascular \nreactivity to MS and CPT was not different between sexes (condition \u00d7 time \u00d7 \nsex, P > 0.05). We conclude that TSD does not significantly alter MAP, MSNA, or \nforearm vascular responses to MS and CPT. The augmented tachycardia responses \nduring and after both acute stressors provide new insight regarding the emerging \nlinks among sleep deprivation, stress, and cardiovascular risk.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.00561.2012\nPMCID: PMC3472479\nPMID: 22815387 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In this research, we evaluated hydrotherapy for \nrecovery from a simulated game of rugby union tracked over a week of training. \nTwenty-four experienced male rugby union players (mean \u00b1 SD age 19.46 \u00b1 0.82 \nyears, weight 82.38 \u00b1 11.12 kg, height 178.54 \u00b1 5.75 cm) were randomly divided \ninto 3 groups: cold water immersion (n = 8), contrast bath therapy (n = 8), and \na control group (n = 8). The 2 forms of hydrotherapy were administered \nimmediately after a simulated rugby game. Testing was conducted 1 hour before \nthe game and at 5 intervals postgame: 1, 48, 72, 96, and 144 hours. Dependent \nvariables included countermovement jump, 10- and 40-m sprints, sessional rating \nof perceived exertion (RPE), flexibility, thigh circumference, and self-reported \ndelayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Significant differences in DOMS were found \nbetween the cold water immersion and contrast bath groups at 48 hours post \nintervention (p = 0.02), and between the control and contrast bath groups at 72 \n(p = 0.03) and 96 (p = 0.04) hours post intervention. Cold water immersion and \ncontrast bath groups reported significantly different RPE at 72 hours (p = ?) \nand 96 hours post (p = 0.05) intervention. Athletes' perceptions of muscle \nsoreness and sessional RPE scores for training were greater in the contrast bath \ngroup (20%) after the simulated game and throughout the training week. Although \nresults from passive and power tests were inconclusive in determining whether \ncold water immersion or passive recovery was more effective in attenuating \nfatigue, results indicated contrast baths had little benefit in enhancing \nrecovery during a cyclic week of rugby union.\n\nDOI: 10.1519\/JSC.0b013e318260ed9b\nPMID: 22796996 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Players were required to choose from a number of recovery modalities \navailable immediately post-game. These included floor stretching, pool \nstretching, bike active recovery, pool active recovery, cold-water immersion, \ncontrast therapy and use of a compression garment. Perceptual measures of \nrecovery were recorded throughout the week and a test of physical performance \nwas conducted two days post-game. Game performance ratings were also recorded. \nThe associations between the post-game recovery protocols chosen and players' \nperceived recovery, and physical and game performances were determined by the \nassociation rule data-mining strategy.\nRESULTS: Statistically significant associations were found between a number of \npost-game recovery protocols and perceptual recovery. In general, players who \nchose cold-water immersion, floor stretching, no active recovery (neither bike \nor pool) and the use of a compression garment post-game, had an increased \nprobability of reporting greater perceptual recovery across the following week, \nrelative to all other permutations of recovery protocols chosen. There were no \nassociations found between post-game recovery protocol combinations and physical \nrecovery. No associations were found between the post-game recovery methods and \nthe next game performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Perceptual recovery among players was enhanced through the \nselection of specific combinations of recovery protocols post game.

On the first visit, an incremental \ntest was performed to determine maximal oxygen consumption and the associated \nspeed (MAS). The remaining 3 visits for the performance of constant velocity \nexhaustive tests at MAS and different recovery methods (6 min) were separated by \n7-day intervals [randomized: CWI, AR or passive recovery (PR)]. The CWI and AR \nlowered [Lac] (p<0.05) at 11, 13 and 15 min after exercise cessation in \ncomparison to PR. There was a 'time' and 'recovery mode' interaction for 2 HRV \nindices: standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN) (partial eta \nsquared=0.114) and natural log of low-frequency power density (lnLF) (partial \neta squared=0.090). CWI presented significantly higher SDNN compared to PR at 15 \nmin of recovery (p<0.05). In addition, greater SDNN values were found in CWI vs. \nAR during the application of recovery interventions, and at 30 and 75 min \npost-exercise (p<0.05 for all differences). The lnLF during the recovery \ninterventions and at 75 min post-exercise was greater using CWI compared with AR \n(p<0.05). For square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences \nbetween adjacent R-R intervals (RMSSD) and natural log of high-frequency power \ndensity (lnHF), a moderate effect size was found between CWI and PR during the \nrecovery interventions and at 15 min post-exercise. Our findings show that AR \nand CWI offer benefits regarding the removal of [Lac] following high-intensity \nexercise. While limited, CWI results in some improvement in post-exercise \ncardiac autonomic regulation compared to AR and PR.

After \nweek 1 training, all players completed a passive recovery (PAS). During week 2, \nCOLD or CWT was randomly assigned. Players undertook the opposing intervention \nin week 3. Repeat-sprint ability (6 \u00d7 20 m), countermovement and squat jumps, \nperceived muscle soreness, and fatigue were measured pretraining and over 48 h \nposttraining.\nRESULTS: Immediately posttraining, groups exhibited similar performance and \npsychometric declines. At 24 h, repeat-sprint time had deteriorated by 4.1% for \nPAS and 1.0% for CWT but was fully restored by COLD (0.0%). At 24 and 48 h, both \nCOLD and CWT attenuated changes in mean muscle soreness, with COLD (0.6 \u00b1 0.6 \nand 0.0 \u00b1 0.4) more effective than CWT (1.9 \u00b1 0.7 and 1.0 \u00b1 0.7) and PAS having \nminimal effect (5.5 \u00b1 0.6 and 4.0 \u00b1 0.5). Similarly, after 24 and 48 h, COLD and \nCWT both effectively reduced changes in perceived fatigue, with COLD (0.6 \u00b1 0.6 \nand 0.0 \u00b1 0.6) being more successful than CWT (0.8 \u00b1 0.6 and 0.7 \u00b1 0.6) and PAS \nhaving the smallest effect (2.2 \u00b1 0.8 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.6).\nCONCLUSIONS: AF training can result in prolonged physical and psychometric \ndeficits persisting for up to 48 h.

Such unloading causes atrophy \npredominantly of the postural muscles, especially those of the lower limbs.\nMETHODS: We tested the hypothesis that 35 d horizontal bed rest alters \nthermoregulatory responses of subjects (N = 10) immersed in 15 degrees C water, \nparticularly the heat produced by the shivering tremor of the skeletal muscles. \nBefore and after bed rest we measured the thickness of the gastrocnemius \nmedialis (GM), vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA), and biceps brachii \n(BB) muscles by ultrasonography. During the immersions, we monitored rectal and \nskin temperatures, heat flux, heart rate, and oxygen uptake.\nRESULTS: After bed rest, muscle thickness decreased significantly by 12.2 +\/- \n8.8% and 8.0 +\/- 9.1% in the GM and VL, respectively. No changes were observed \nin the TA and BB muscles. The 35-d bed rest caused a significant reduction in \naerobic power, as reflected in maximal oxygen uptake. There were no significant \ndifferences in any of the observed thermoregulatory responses between the pre- \nand post-bed rest immersions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular and muscular deconditioning had no effect on the \nheat production and heat loss responses. Due to the significant reduction in the \nmass of the muscles in the lower limbs, concomitant with no change in heat \nproduction, we conclude that leg muscles do not play a significant role in \nshivering thermogenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.3357\/asem.3040.2012\nPMID: 22606862 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Pain modulation consisted of rating of heat pain \n(palm) during concurrent cold water immersion (foot). Compared to baseline heat \npain ratings, concurrent foot immersion lowered pain intensity ratings, which \nsuggests an inhibitory effect, was reduced with naltrexone, suggesting at least \npartial dependence of inhibition on endogenous opioids. An exploratory analysis \nrevealed that individual differences in catastrophizing moderated the effects of \nnaltrexone; endogenous opioid blockade abolished modulation in subjects lower in \ncatastrophizing while modulation was unaffected by naltrexone among high \ncatastrophizers. The results suggest a role of endogenous opioids in endogenous \nanalgesia, but hint that multiple systems might contribute to conditioned pain \nmodulation, and that these systems might be differentially activated as a \nfunction of individual differences in responses to pain.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s10865-012-9424-2\nPMCID: PMC3774309\nPMID: 22534819 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Here we have \ncompared responses of MSNA and BP during arousal induced by an electrical skin \nstimulus and mental stress evoked by a 3 min paced auditory serial arithmetic \ntest (PASAT) in 30 healthy males aged 33 \u00b1 10 years. In addition, recordings \nwere made of ECG, respiratory movements, electrodermal activity and perceived \nstress. We also monitored corresponding effects of a cold test (CT: 2 min \nimmersion of a hand in ice water). The arousal stimulus evoked significant \ninhibition of one or two MSNA bursts in 16 subjects, who were classified as \nresponders; the remaining 14 subjects were non-responders. During mental stress \nresponders showed a significant decrease of MSNA and a lesser BP increase \ncompared to non-responders. In non-responders MSNA was unchanged or increased. \nPerceived stress was higher in non-responders (P = 0.056), but other measures \nwere similar in the two groups. In non-responders mental stress and the cold \ntest induced increases of BP that lasted throughout the subsequent rest period. \nDuring the cold test MSNA and BP increased equally in responders and \nnon-responders. In the whole group of subjects, there was a significant \ncorrelation (r = 0.80, P < 0.001) between MSNA responses induced by arousal and \nby mental stress but not between responses evoked by arousal and the cold test \n(r < 0.1, P > 0.6). Additionally arousal-induced MSNA change was positively \ncorrelated with blood pressure changes during MS (systolic BP: r = 0.48; P < \n0.01; diastolic BP: r = 0.42; P < 0.05) but not with blood pressure changes \nduring CT. We conclude that in males the MSNA response to arousal predicts the \nMSNA and BP responses to mental stress.\n\nDOI: 10.1113\/jphysiol.2012.228981\nPMCID: PMC3448154\nPMID: 22526886 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

LAN@HST.AAU.DK\n\nOBJECTIVES: The descending pain inhibitory system is impaired in chronic pain \nand it is important to know how analgesics interact with this system. The aim of \nthis human experimental pain, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3 \nway cross-over study was to investigate the effect of 2 different opioids on \ndescending pain inhibition using conditioning pain modulation (CPM) as a \nscreening tool.\nMETHODS: Twenty-two healthy male volunteers were randomized to 72 hours of \ntreatment with transdermal patches of fentanyl (25 \u03bcg\/h), buprenorphine (20 \n\u03bcg\/h), or placebo. The CPM was induced by immersing the hand into cold (3.0 \u00b1 \n0.3\u00b0C) water and the evoked pain was continuously rated on a visual analogue \nscale (VAS). The test stimulus [pressure pain tolerance threshold (PPTol)] was \napplied to the contra-lateral arm. The CPM test was performed at baseline, 24, \n48, and 72 hours after application of the patches.\nRESULTS: The opioid treatments did not significantly (F=2.249; P=0.07) modulate \nthe PPTol over the treatment period compared with placebo. The CPM-evoked PPTol \nincreases (percentage increase from what was obtained at the baseline before \npatch application) were significantly enhanced by buprenorphine (P=0.004) and \nfentanyl (P=0.005) compared with placebo, with no differences between the 2 \nactive drugs. Fentanyl significantly attenuated the time to cold water-evoked \nVAS peak compared with placebo (P=0.005), and the same trend was observed for \nbuprenorphine (P=0.06). The VAS pain intensity was not affected.\nDISCUSSION: The opioids buprenorphine and fentanyl significantly potentiate the \neffect of descending pain inhibition in healthy volunteers.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/AJP.0b013e31823e15cb\nPMID: 22156892 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, it is unclear how these \nparameters change during the post-cooling period and how the exercise carried \nout in this period would influence the recovery of nerve conduction velocity \n(NCV).\nOBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of three cryotherapy modalities on \npost-cooling NCV and to analyze the effect of walking on the recovery of sensory \nand motor NCV.\nMETHODS: Thirty six healthy young subjects were randomly allocated into three \ngroups: ice massage (n=12), ice pack (n=12) and cold water immersion (n=12). The \nmodalities were applied to the right leg. The subjects of each modality group \nwere again randomized to perform a post-cooling activity: a) 30 min rest, b) \nwalking 15 min followed by 15 min rest. The NCV of sural (sensory) and posterior \ntibial (motor) nerves was evaluated. Initial (pre-cooling) and final (30 min \npost-cooling) NCV were compared using a paired t-test. The effects of the \nmodalities and the post-cooling activities on NCV were evaluated by an analysis \nof covariance.

The \npurpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cooling methods on \ncore body temperature, heart rate (HR), and perceptual readings in individuals \nafter exercise. Sixteen subjects (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, height: 182 \u00b1 7 cm, weight: \n74.03 \u00b1 9.17 kg, and body fat: 17.08 \u00b1 6.23%) completed 10 exercise sessions in \nwarm conditions (WBGT: 26.64 \u00b1 4.71\u00b0C) followed by body cooling by 10 different \nmethods. Cooling methods included cold water immersion (CWI), shade, \nPort-a-Cool\u00ae (FAN), Emergency Cold Containment System\u00ae (ECCS), Rehab. Hood\u00ae \n(HOOD), Game Ready Active Cooling Vest\u2122 (GRV), Nike Ice Vest\u2122 (NIV), ice buckets \n(IBs), and ice towels (IT). These cooling modes were compared with a control \n(SUN). Rectal temperature (T(re)), HR, thermal sensation, thirst sensation, and \na 56-question Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire (ESQ) were used to assess \nphysiological and perceptual data. Average T(re) after exercise across all \ntrials was 38.73 \u00b1 0.12\u00b0C. After 10 minutes of cooling, CWI (-0.65 \u00b1 0.29\u00b0C), \nECCS (-0.68 \u00b1 0.24\u00b0C), and IB (-0.74 \u00b1 0.34\u00b0C) had significantly (p < 0.006) \ngreater decreases in T(re) compared with that in SUN (-0.42 \u00b1 0.15\u00b0C). The HR \nafter 10 minutes of cooling was significantly (p < 0.006) lower for CWI (82 \u00b1 15 \nb\u00b7min(-1)), ECCS (87 \u00b1 14 b\u00b7min(-1)), and IT (84 \u00b1 15 b\u00b7min(-1)) when compared \nwith SUN (101 \u00b1 15 b\u00b7min(-1)). The thermal sensation between modalities was all \nsignificantly (p < 0.006) lower (CWI: 1.5 \u00b1 0.5; Fan: 3.0 \u00b1 1.0; ECCS: 4.5 \u00b1 \n1.0; Hood: 4.5 \u00b1 0.5; GRV: 4.0 \u00b1 0.5; NIV: 4.5 \u00b1 1.0; IB: 4.0 \u00b1 1.0; IT: 3.0 \u00b1 \n1.0) when compared with SUN (5.5 \u00b1 0.5), except for Shade (5.0 \u00b1 1.0). There \nwere no significant differences (p > 0.006) in thirst sensation between \nmodalities.

Twelve subjects had two microdialysis \nfibres placed in the ventral forearm and were immersed to the sternum in a \nbathtub on parallel study days (normoxia and poikilocapnic hypoxia with an \narterial O(2) saturation of 80%). One fibre served as the control (1 mM \npropranolol) and the other received 5 mM yohimbine (plus 1 mM propranolol) to \nblock adrenergic receptors. Skin blood flow was assessed at each site (laser \nDoppler flowmetry), divided by mean arterial pressure to calculate cutaneous \nvascular conductance (CVC), and scaled to baseline. Cold exposure was first \ninduced by a progressive reduction in water temperature from 36 to 23\u00b0C over 30 \nmin to assess cutaneous vascular regulation, then by clamping the water \ntemperature at 10\u00b0C for 45 min to test defense of core temperature. During \nnormoxia, cold stress reduced CVC in control (-44 \u00b1 4%) and yohimbine sites (-13 \n\u00b1 7%; both P < 0.05 versus precooling). Hypoxia caused vasodilatation prior to \ncooling but resulted in greater reductions in CVC in control (-67 \u00b1 7%) and \nyohimbine sites (-35 \u00b1 11%) during cooling (both P < 0.05 versus precooling; \nboth P < 0.05 versus normoxia). Core cooling rate during the second phase of \ncold exposure was unaffected by hypoxia (-1.81 \u00b1 0.23\u00b0C h(-1) in normoxia versus \n-1.97 \u00b1 0.33\u00b0C h(-1) in hypoxia; P > 0.05). We conclude that hypoxia increases \ncutaneous (non-noradrenergic) vasoconstriction during prolonged cold exposure, \nwhile core cooling rate is not consistently affected.\n\nDOI: 10.1113\/expphysiol.2011.059147\nPMID: 21705404 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

It has been thought that the temperature of repeated \ncold exposures during the adaptation period is one of the factors affecting the \ntype of cold adaptation developed. This study tested the hypothesis that \nrepeated mild cold immersions would induce an insulative cold adaptation but \nwould not alter the metabolic response. Seven healthy male participants were \nimmersed to their xiphoid process level repeatedly in 26\u00b0C water for 60 min, 3 \ndays every week, for 4 weeks. During the first and last exposure of this cold \nacclimation period, the participants underwent body immersion tests measuring \ntheir thermoregulatory responses to cold. Separately, they conducted finger \nimmersion into 5\u00b0C water for 30 min to assess their cold-induced vasodilation \n(CIVD) response before and after cold acclimation. During the immersion to \nxiphoid process, participants showed significantly lower mean skin temperature \nand skin blood flow in the forearm post-acclimation, while no adaptation was \nobserved in the metabolic response. Additionally, blunted CIVD responses were \nobserved after cold acclimation. From these results, it was considered that the \nparticipants showed an insulative-type of cold acclimation after the repeated \nmild cold immersions. The major finding of this study was the acceptance of the \nhypothesis that repeated mild cold immersion was sufficient to induce insulative \ncold adaptation but did not alter the metabolic response. It is suggested that \nthe adaptation in the thermoregulatory response is specific to the response \nwhich is repeatedly stimulated during the adaptation process.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00484-011-0462-1\nPMID: 21695574 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The Wingate group (n = 8) performed 3 \u00d7 30-s Wingate \ntests (4-min rest periods). The repeated intermittent sprint group (n = 8) \ncycled for alternating 30-s periods at 40% of predetermined maximum power and \n120% maximum power, until exhaustion. Both groups completed three trials using a \ndifferent recovery treatment for each trial (balanced randomized application). \nRecovery treatments were passive rest, 1:1 contrast water immersion (2.5 min of \ncold (8\u00b0C) to 2.5 min of hot (40\u00b0C)), and 1:4 contrast water immersion (1 min of \ncold to 4 min of hot). Blood lactate and HR were recorded throughout, and peak \npower and total work for pre- and postrecovery Wingate performance and exercise \ntime and total work for repeated sprinting were recorded.\nRESULTS: Recovery of Wingate peak power was 8% greater after 1:4 contrast water \nimmersion than after passive rest, whereas both contrast water immersion ratios \nprovided a greater recovery of exercise time (\u223c 10%) and total work (\u223c 14%) for \nrepeated sprinting than for passive rest. Blood lactate was similar between \ntrials. Compared with passive rest, HR initially declined more slowly during \ncontrast water immersion but increased with each transition to a cold immersion \nphase.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data support contrast water immersion being effective in \nmaintaining performance during a short-term recovery from sprint exercise. This \neffect needs further investigation but is likely explained by cardiovascular \nmechanisms, shown here by an elevation in HR upon each cold immersion.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e31821d06d9\nPMID: 21502898 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We investigated the effects of various classes of anti-motion \nsickness drugs on core temperature changes.\nMETHODS: There were 12 healthy male and female subjects (20-35 yr old) who were \ngiven selected classes of anti-motion sickness drugs prior to vestibular \nCoriolis cross coupling induced by graded yaw rotation and periodic \npitch-forward head movements in the sagittal plane. All subjects were then \nimmersed in water at 18 degrees C for a maximum of 90 min or until their core \ntemperature reached 35 degrees C.

Immediately following the evolution, the \nsubjects removed their thermal protective clothing and were randomized to \nreceive forearm immersion (FI), ice water perfused cooling vest (CV), or passive \n(P) cooling in an air-conditioned medical trailer for 30 minutes. Heart rate and \ndeep gastric temperature were monitored every 5 minutes during recovery.\nRESULTS: A single 20-minute bout of fire suppression resulted in near-maximal \nmean \u00b1 standard deviation HR (175 \u00b1 13 b min(-1), P; 172 \u00b1 20 b\u00b7min(-1), FI; 177 \n\u00b1 12 b\u00b7min(-1), CV) when compared with baseline (p < 0.001), a rapid and \nsubstantial rise in T(c) (38.2\u00b0 \u00b1 0.7\u00b0, P; 38.3\u00b0 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0, FI; 38.3\u00b0 \u00b1 0.3\u00b0, CV) \ncompared with baseline (p < 0.001), and body mass lost from sweating of nearly 1 \nkilogram. Cooling rates (\u00b0C\u00b7min) differed (p = 0.036) by device, with FI (0.05 \u00b1 \n0.04) providing higher rates than P (0.03 \u00b1 0.02) or CV (0.03 \u00b1 0.04), although \ndifferences over 30 minutes were small and recovery of body temperature was \nincomplete in all groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: During 30 minutes of recovery following a 20-minute bout of fire \nsuppression in a training academy setting, there is a slightly higher cooling \nrate for FI and no apparent benefit to CV when compared with P cooling in a \nmoderate temperature environment.\n\nDOI: 10.3109\/10903127.2010.545482\nPMCID: PMC3086381\nPMID: 21294631 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-male soccer players completed one match and \nwere randomly divided into cryotherapy (10 min cold water immersion, 10\u00b0C, n = \n10) and thermoneutral (10 min thermoneutral water immersion, 35\u00b0C, n = 10) \ngroups. Muscle damage (creatine kinase, myoglobin), inflammation (C-reactive \nprotein), neuromuscular function (jump and sprint abilities and maximal \nisometric quadriceps strength), and delayed-onset muscle soreness were evaluated \nbefore, within 30 min of the end, and 24 and 48 h after the match. After the \nmatch, the players in both groups showed increased plasma creatine kinase \nactivity (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 min) and C-reactive protein (30 \nmin, 24 h) concentrations. Peak jump ability and maximal strength were decreased \nand delayed-onset muscle soreness increased in both groups. However, \ndifferential alterations were observed between thermoneutral water and cold \nwater immersion groups in creatine kinase (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), myoglobin (30 \nmin), C-reactive protein (30 min, 24 h, 48 h), quadriceps strength (24 h), and \nquadriceps (24 h), calf (24 h) and adductor (30 min) delayed-onset muscle \nsoreness.

The recovery intervention consisted of different water \nimmersion techniques, including: temperate water immersion (36\u00b0C; TWI), cold \nwater immersion (10\u00b0C; CWI), contrast water temperature (10-42\u00b0C; CWT) and a \npassive recovery (PAS). Performances during a maximal 30-s rowing test (P(30 \ns)), a maximal vertical counter-movement jump (CMJ) and a maximal isometric \nvoluntary contraction (MVC) of the knee extensor muscles were measured at rest \n(Pre-exercise), immediately after the exercise (Post-exercise), 1 h after (Post \n1 h) and 24 h later (Post 24 h). Leukocyte profile and venous blood markers of \nmuscle damage (creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were also \nmeasured Pre-exercise, Post 1 h and Post 24 h. A significant time effect was \nobserved to indicate a reduction in performance (Pre-exercise vs. Post-exercise) \nfollowing the exercise bout in all conditions (P < 0.05). Indeed, at 1 h post \nexercise, a significant improvement in MVC and P(30 s) was respectively observed \nin the CWI and CWT groups compared to pre-exercise.

In the present study we compared the \nshort-term effects of cold water immersion therapy (CWIT) and light emitting \ndiode therapy (LEDT) with placebo LEDT on biochemical markers related to \nskeletal muscle recovery after high-intensity exercise. A randomized \ndouble-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed with six male \nyoung futsal athletes. They were treated with CWIT (5\u00b0C of temperature [SD \n\u00b11\u00b0]), active LEDT (69 LEDs with wavelengths 660\/850\u00a0nm, 10\/30\u00a0mW of output \npower, 30 s of irradiation time per point, and 41.7\u00a0J of total energy irradiated \nper point, total of ten points irradiated) or an identical placebo LEDT 5\u00a0min \nafter each of three Wingate cycle tests. Pre-exercise, post-exercise, and \npost-treatment measurements were taken of blood lactate levels, creatine kinase \n(CK) activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. There were no significant \ndifferences in the work performed during the three Wingate tests (p\u2009>\u20090.05). All \nbiochemical parameters increased from baseline values (p\u2009<\u20090.05) after the three \nexercise tests, but only active LEDT decreased blood lactate levels (p\u2009=\u20090.0065) \nand CK activity (p\u2009=\u20090.0044) significantly after treatment. There were no \nsignificant differences in CRP values after treatments. We concluded that \ntreating the leg muscles with LEDT 5\u00a0min after the Wingate cycle test seemed to \ninhibit the expected post-exercise increase in blood lactate levels and CK \nactivity. This suggests that LEDT has better potential than 5\u00a0min of CWIT for \nimproving short-term post-exercise recovery.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s10103-010-0866-x\nPMCID: PMC3119799\nPMID: 21088862 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflicts \nof interest.",

In separate \nlaboratory trials, immersion vaccination of channel catfish (Ictalurus \npunctatus) fry between 10 to 48 days post hatch (DPH) with experimental vaccine \nor licensed product resulted in relative percent survival (RPS) between 57-94% \nfollowing challenge. Similarly, a vaccination\/challenge trial using largemouth \nbass (Micropterus salmoides) fry at 10 DPH was performed using various doses of \nlicensed product under laboratory conditions. Results demonstrated safety of the \nvaccine and significant protection following challenge with RPS values between \n74-94%, depending on vaccine dose. Together, these trials demonstrate the \nvaccine administered to early life-stage channel catfish and largemouth bass is \nsafe and reduces mortality following challenge with F. columnare.\n\nPublished by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.fsi.2010.11.001\nPMID: 21059396 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, concerns exist over potential overcooling of \nhyperthermic individuals during cold-water immersion.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the recommendation that removing previously hyperthermic \nindividuals from a cold-water bath at a rectal temperature (T(re)) of 38.6\u00b0C \nwould attenuate overcooling.\nDESIGN: Controlled laboratory study.\nSETTING: University research laboratory.\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 6 men and 4 women (age \u200a=\u200a \n22 \u00b1 3 years, height \u200a=\u200a 172 \u00b1 10 cm, mass \u200a=\u200a 67.8 \u00b1 10.7 kg, body fat \npercentage \u200a=\u200a 17.1% \u00b1 4.5%, maximum oxygen consumption \u200a=\u200a 59.3 \u00b1 8.7 \nmL\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)).\nINTERVENTION(S): After exercising at an ambient temperature of 40.0\u00b0C for 38.5 \u00b1 \n9.4 minutes, until T(re) reached 39.5\u00b0C, participants were immersed in a 2.0\u00b0C \ncirculated water bath until T(re) decreased to either 37.5\u00b0C or 38.6\u00b0C. \nSubsequently, participants were removed from the water bath and recovered for 20 \nminutes at an ambient temperature of 25\u00b0C.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rectal and esophageal temperatures were measured \ncontinuously during the immersion and recovery periods.\nRESULTS: Because of the experimental design, the overall time of immersion was \ngreater during the 37.5\u00b0C trial (16.6 \u00b1 5.7 minutes) than the 38.6\u00b0C trial (8.8 \n\u00b1 2.6 minutes) (t(9) \u200a=\u200a -4.740, P \u200a=\u200a .001). During the recovery period after \ncold-water immersion, both rectal (F(1,9) \u200a=\u200a 50.540, P < .001) and esophageal \n(F(1,6) \u200a=\u200a 20.365, P \u200a=\u200a .007) temperatures remained greater in the 38.6\u00b0C \ntrial than in the 37.5\u00b0C trial.

In addition, cold water \nimmersion (CWI) itself has been shown to reduce the concentration of the hormone \nleptin, high concentrations of which signal satiety. Taken together, these \nfindings raise the question of whether the common practice of postexercise CWI \nby athletes acutely affects energy intake. Hence, this study investigated the \nacute effect of CWI after exercise on subsequent energy intake and macronutrient \npreferences as well as the circulating levels of a range of appetite-related \nhormones.\nMETHODS: Ten physically active men participated in three randomized, \ncounterbalanced trials consisting of 40 min of treadmill running (70% \nVO(2peak)), followed by 20 min of CWI (15\u00b0C), neutral water immersion (NWI; \n33\u00b0C), or a resting control with no immersion (CON). Participants were then \ngiven a 30-min access to a buffet-type breakfast of precisely known quantity and \nnutrient composition from which they could consume ad libitum.\nRESULTS: Participants consumed significantly more energy after both CWI (mean \u00b1 \nSD = 4893 \u00b1 1554 kJ, P = 0.006) and NWI (5167 \u00b1 1975 kJ, P = 0.010) compared \nwith CON (4089 \u00b1 1585 kJ). However, there was no significant difference in total \nenergy intake between the CWI and the NWI trials (P = 0.595). These changes were \nassociated with a significant interaction effect of time and trial on both \nleptin (P = 0.045) and active ghrelin (P = 0.046).\nCONCLUSION: Postexercise water immersion is associated with higher energy intake \nin the subsequent meal compared with CON. This is an important consideration for \ntrained men using water immersion as a method of recovery from exercise.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e3181f55d2e\nPMID: 20798665 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Heat acclimation increased power output at lactate threshold by 5% \nin cool (3.88 \u00b1 0.82 vs. 4.09 \u00b1 0.76 W\/kg, P = 0.002) and by 5% in hot (3.45 \u00b1 \n0.80 vs. 3.60 \u00b1 0.79 W\/kg, P < 0.001) conditions. Heat acclimation increased \nplasma volume (6.5 \u00b1 1.5%) and maximal cardiac output in cool and hot conditions \n(9.1 \u00b1 3.4% and 4.5 \u00b1 4.6%, respectively). The control group had no changes in \nVO2max, time-trial performance, lactate threshold, or any physiological \nparameters.

Ten subjects completed \ntwo testing sessions separated by 1 week; each trial consisted of an initial \nall-out 35-min exercise bout, one of two 15-min recovery interventions \n(randomised: CWI or ACT), followed by a 40-min passive recovery period before \nrepeating the 35-min exercise bout. Performance was measured as the change in \ntotal work completed during the exercise bouts. Resting limb blood flow, heart \nrate, rectal temperature and blood lactate were recorded throughout the testing \nsessions. There was a significant decline in performance after ACT (mean (SD) \n-1.81% (1.05%)) compared with CWI where performance remained unchanged (0.10% \n(0.71%)). Rectal temperature was reduced after CWI (36.8\u00b0C (1.0\u00b0C)) compared \nwith ACT (38.3\u00b0C (0.4\u00b0C)), as was blood flow to the arms (CWI 3.64 (1.47) ml\/100 \nml\/min; ACT 16.85 (3.57) ml\/100 ml\/min) and legs (CW 4.83 (2.49) ml\/100 ml\/min; \nACT 4.83 (2.49) ml\/100 ml\/min). Leg blood flow at the end of the second exercise \nbout was not different between the active (15.25 (4.33) ml\/100 ml\/min) and cold \ntrials (14.99 (4.96) ml\/100 ml\/min), whereas rectal temperature (CWI 38.1\u00b0C \n(0.3\u00b0C); ACT 38.8\u00b0C (0.2\u00b0C)) and arm blood flow (CWI 20.55 (3.78) ml\/100 ml\/min; \nACT 23.83 (5.32) ml\/100 ml\/min) remained depressed until the end of the cold \ntrial. These findings indicate that CWI is an effective intervention for \nmaintaining repeat cycling performance in the heat and this performance benefit \nis associated with alterations in core temperature and limb blood flow.\n\nDOI: 10.1136\/bjsm.2009.067272\nPMID: 20233843 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, little information is available about \nhow different measurements of body temperature respond during and after \nexertional heat stress.\nOBJECTIVE: To present the temporal responses of aural canal (T(ac)), esophageal \n(T(es)), and rectal (T(re)) temperatures during 2 different scenarios (S1, S2) \ninvolving exertional heat stress and a subsequent recovery period.\nDESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.\nSETTING: University research laboratory.\nPATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers, with 12 (5 men, \n7 women) participating in S1 and 12 (7 men, 5 women) participating in S2.\nINTERVENTION(S): The participants exercised in the heat (42 degrees C, 30% \nrelative humidity) until they reached a 39.5 degrees C cut-off criterion, which \nwas determined by T(re) in S1 and by T(es) in S2. As such, participants attained \ndifferent levels of hyperthermia (as determined by T(re)) at the end of \nexercise. Participants in S1 were subsequently immersed in cold water (2 degrees \nC) until T(re) reached 37.5 degrees C, and participants in S2 recovered in a \ntemperate environment (30 degrees C, 30% relative humidity) for 60 minutes.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We measured T(ac), T(es), and T(re) throughout both \nscenarios.\nRESULTS: The T(es) (S1 = 40.19 +\/- 0.41 degrees C, S2 = 39.50 +\/- 0.02 degrees \nC) was higher at the end of exercise compared with both T(ac) (S1 = 39.74 +\/- \n0.42 degrees C, S2 = 38.89 +\/- 0.32 degrees C) and T(re) (S1 = 39.41 +\/- 0.04 \ndegrees C, S2 = 38.74 +\/- 0.28 degrees C) (for both comparisons in each \nscenario, P < .001). Conversely, T(es) (S1 = 36.26 +\/- 0.74 degrees C, S2 = \n37.36 +\/- 0.34 degrees C) and T(ac) (S1 = 36.48 +\/- 1.07 degrees C, S2 = 36.97 \n+\/- 0.38 degrees C) were lower compared with T(re) (S1 = 37.54 +\/- 0.04 degrees \nC, S2 = 37.78 +\/- 0.31 degrees C) at the end of both scenarios (for both \ncomparisons in each scenario, P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: We found that T(ac), T(es), and T(re) presented different temporal \nresponses during and after both scenarios of exertional heat stress and a \nsubsequent recovery period.

However, few studies have compared the effect of \ndifferent cold modalities on nerve conduction parameters.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ice pack, ice \nmassage, and cold water immersion on the conduction parameters of the sural \n(sensorial) and tibial motor nerves.\nDESIGN: An experimental study was conducted in which the participants were \nrandomly assigned to 1 of 3 intervention groups (n=12 per group). Independent \nvariables were cold modality and pre- and post-cooling measurement time. \nDependent variables were skin temperature and nerve conduction parameters.\nMETHODS: Thirty-six people who were healthy, with a mean (SD) age of 20.5 (1.9) \nyears, participated in the study. Each group received 1 of the 3 cold \nmodalities, applied to the right calf region for 15 minutes. Skin temperature \nand nerve conduction parameters were measured before and immediately after \ncooling.\nRESULTS: All 3 modalities reduced skin temperature (mean=18.2 degrees C). There \nalso was a reduction in amplitude and an increase in latency and duration of the \ncompound action potential. Ice massage, ice pack, and cold water immersion \nreduced sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) by 20.4, 16.7, and 22.6 m\/s and \nmotor NCV by 2.5, 2.1, and 8.3 m\/s, respectively. Cold water immersion was the \nmost effective modality in changing nerve conduction parameters.\nLIMITATIONS: The cooling area of the ice massage and ice pack was smaller than \nthat of the cold water immersion. The examiner was not blinded to the treatment \ngroup. The population included only participants who were healthy and young.\nCONCLUSIONS: All 3 modalities were effective in reducing skin temperature and \nchanging sensory conduction at a physiological level that is sufficient to \ninduce a hypoalgesic effect. The results suggest that cold water immersion, as \napplied in this study, is the most indicated modality for inducing therapeutic \neffects associated with the reduction of motor nerve conduction.\n\nDOI: 10.2522\/ptj.20090131\nPMID: 20185615 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Ten \nwell-trained swimmers (5 males, 5 females; 19.0 +\/- 3.9 years) performed two \n100-m swimming sprints (S1 and S2) interspersed with a 30-min passive recovery \nperiod, during which athletes were randomly assigned to 5 min of CWI (14 degrees \nC) or an out-of-water control condition (CON 28 degrees C). During tests, sprint \ntimes, heart rate (HR), pre- and post-race parasympathetic activity via HR \nvariability (natural logarithm of the square root of the mean of the sum of the \nsquares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals; Ln rMSSD) and \nblood lactate accumulation ([La](ac)) and clearance ([La](cle)) were recorded. \nRates of perceived recovery (RPR) and exertion (RPE) were evaluated before and \nafter each sprint. CWI was associated with a 'likely' decrease in swimming \nperformance [1.8% (90% CI 0.2, 3.5)], as well as 'likely' lower peak HR [-1.9% \n(-3.6, -0.2)]. CWI was also associated with a 'likely' smaller decrease in Ln \nrMSSD after the first sprint [-16.7% (-30.9, -4.1)]. RPR was 'likely' better \n[+27.2% (-3.7, 68.0)] following CWI.

Following CWI, changes in sprint times were 'largely' correlated \nwith changes in peak HR (r = 0.80).

Before the time trials, \nparticipants underwent either a 20-min lower-body cold-water immersion procedure \nor no cooling intervention. Before and after the intervention and the time \ntrial, voluntary force (maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)), superimposed force \n(SIF), evoked twitch force (peak twitch force (Pf)), muscle temperature, and \nblood metabolites were measured. Further, measures of core and skin temperature \nand HR were recorded before, during, and after cooling and time trial.\nRESULTS: Results indicated that cycling performance was improved with precooling \n(198 +\/- 25 vs 178 +\/- 26 W for precooling and control, respectively; P = 0.05). \nAlthough core, muscle, skin, and mean body temperatures were lower in the \ncooling condition until the 20th minute (P < 0.05), performance did not differ \nuntil the last 10 min of the time trial, by which time no differences in \nphysiological measures were present.

However, the effect of \nambient temperature during land-based exercise is not known.\nOBJECTIVES: Our aims were to investigate the effect of exercise performed in the \nheat on energy intake in the subsequent meal and to determine concentrations of \ncirculating appetite-related hormones.\nDESIGN: In a randomized, counterbalanced design, 11 active male participants \ncompleted 3 experimental trials in a fasted state: exercise in the heat (36 \ndegrees C), exercise in a neutral temperature (25 degrees C), and a resting \ncontrol (25 degrees C). The exercise trials consisted of treadmill running for \n40 min at 70% VO(2peak). After each trial, participants were presented with a \nbuffet-type breakfast of precisely known quantity and nutrient composition, \nwhich they could consume ad libitum.\nRESULTS: Energy intake was greater after exercise in the neutral temperature \ncompared with the control (P = 0.021) but was similar between exercise in the \nheat and the control and between the 2 exercise trials. When accounting for the \nexcess energy expended during exercise, relative energy intake during exercise \nin the heat was lower than the control (P = 0.002) but was similar between \nexercise in the neutral temperature and the control and between exercise in the \nheat and in the neutral temperature. The lower relative energy intake after \nexercise in the heat was associated with an elevated tympanic temperature and \ncirculating concentrations of peptide YY (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Exercise in a neutral environmental temperature is associated with \nhigher energy intake in the subsequent meal compared with a control, whereas \nexercise in the heat is not.\n\nDOI: 10.3945\/ajcn.2009.28162\nPMID: 19793848 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Effect size data indicated trends \nfor an ameliorated decline in 5 x 20-m sprints and vertical jump for C(T)WT and \nCWI, respectively. C(T)WT demonstrated a significant reduction (p = 0.04) in \nlactate post-intervention compared to ACT recovery. Further, ACT recovery \nresulted in a significantly elevated (p < 0.01) heart rate compared to all other \nconditions postintervention and demonstrated significantly higher (p < 0.01) \nrating of perceived exertion postintervention and muscle soreness pre-exercise \nSession 2.

Performance (vertical jump height), \nphysiological (heart rate and tympanic temperature), and perceptual measures \n(perceived quality of recovery) were determined before each match, 10 minutes \nafter each match, after each recovery method, and after 24 hours. There was a \n0.6 +\/- 6.7% drop in immediately after a match, but there was no difference in \nvertical jump height after 24 hours (p = 0.997). Perceived quality of recovery \nimmediately after COMB was substantially higher than CONT and PASS, but the \neffect did not last more than 24 hours.

The sequence of both trials was \nalternated and participants were randomly assigned to sequence order and \nparallelized with respect to gender. Physiological parameters (cardiovascular, \nrespiratory and electrodermal activity) and subjective pain intensity were \ncontinuously monitored. In addition, pain detection and tolerance thresholds as \nwell as pain unpleasantness were assessed. Both tests were comparable with \nregard to the time course and intensity of subjective pain. However, a \nsignificantly higher increase of blood pressure could be observed during the CPT \nwhen compared to the HIT.

On each occasion, they had to perform two climbing tests (C1 \nand C2) until volitional exhaustion on a prepracticed route (overhanging wall, \nlevel 6b). These two tests were separated by 20 min of recovery. Four recovery \nmethods were used in randomized order: passive recovery, active recovery (cycle \nergometer, 30-40 W), electromyostimulation on the forearm muscles (bisymmetric \nTENS current), or cold water immersion of the forearms and arms (three periods \nof 5 min at 15 +\/- 1 degrees C). Climbing tests' performance was reflected by \nthe number of arm movements and climb duration.\nRESULTS: Using active recovery and cold water immersion, performance at C2 was \nmaintained in comparison with C1, whereas C2 performance was impaired compared \nwith C1 (P< 0.01) using electromyostimulation and passive recovery (recovery \nmethod-by-climb interaction, P < 0.05). Blood lactate decreased during recovery, \nwith the greatest decrease occurring during active recovery (time-by-recovery \nmethod interaction, P < 0.001). Arms and forearms' skin temperatures were lower \nthroughout the cold water immersion compared with the other three methods (P < \n0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Active recovery and cold water immersion are two means of preserving \nperformance when repeating acute exhausting climbing trails in female climbers. \nThese positive effects are accompanied by a greater lactate removal and a \ndecrease in subcutaneous tissues temperatures, respectively.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e318195107d\nPMID: 19461534 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

CPT was induced by immersing a hand in water at 40 \ndegrees C for 2 minutes.\nRESULTS: Administration of vitamin E reduced SBP (p<0.001), DBP (p<0.001), MAP \n(p<0.001), HR (p<0.001) and FVR (p<0.05) but increased FBF (p<0.01).

Pain was induced by immersing the non-dominant foot in 2 degrees C \nice-water for as long as possible or until 4 min had elapsed (the cold pressor \ntest). Blood pressure was measured before each cold pressor test, and at 2-min \nintervals during mental arithmetic. In the group as a whole, neither depression \nnor naltrexone influenced blood pressure at any stage of the experiment. \nHowever, naltrexone disrupted an association between elevated resting blood \npressure and low levels of pain in non-depressed controls, suggesting that \nendogenous opioid peptides are involved in blood pressure-mediated analgesia. \nEffects were similar when expressed in relation to blood pressure during \npsychological stress. In contrast to controls, blood pressure was unrelated to \npain in depressed participants in the placebo condition. However, naltrexone \nunmasked an association between blood pressure and pain--those with highest \nblood pressure reported least cold-induced pain. Thus, endogenous opioids \napparently masked an analgesic mechanism linking elevated blood pressure with \nreduced sensitivity to pain in participants with major depressive disorder. \nNoradrenergic mechanisms involved in active coping, stress-induced analgesia and \nbaroreflexes might account for these findings.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.pain.2008.11.014\nPMID: 19167814 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

There are no \nstudies in the medical literature examining the effects of these weapons on the \nhuman stress response. This is the first study to compare the human stress \nresponse to conducted electrical weapons, oleoresin capsicum (O.C.), a \ncold-water tank immersion, and a defensive tactics drill.\nMETHODS: Subjects were randomized to one of the four interventions studied. \nSubjects received either a 5-s exposure from the TASER X26 CEW with the probes \nfired into the back from 7 ft, a 5-s spray of O.C., a skin and mucous membrane \nirritant, to the eyes, a 45-s exposure of the hand and forearm in a 0 degrees C \ncold water tank, or a 1-min defensive tactics drill.\nRESULTS: Alpha-amylase had the greatest increase from baseline at 10-15 min with \nthe defensive tactics drill. Cortisol had the greatest increase at 15-20 min \nwith O.C. Cortisol remained most elevated at 40-60 min in the defensive tactics \ndrill group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggests that physical exertion during \ncustodial arrest may be most activating of the human stress response, \nparticularly the sympathetic-adrenal-medulla axis. This may suggest that \ntechniques to limit the duration of this exertion may be the safest means to \napprehend subjects, particularly those at high-risk for in-custody death. \nConducted electrical weapons were not more activating of the human stress \nresponse than other uses of force.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.forsciint.2008.09.015\nPMID: 19019594 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Most of the cold injuries in real life, however, occur in the foot in \ncold air rather than in the hand in cold water. Therefore, an experiment was \nconducted to investigate the within-subject relation between CIVD in the fingers \nand toes exposed to cold water and cold air.\nMETHODS: In 4 experimental sessions, 11 healthy male subjects immersed their \ntoes and fingers in 5 degrees C water and exposed the fingers and toes to -18 \ndegrees C cold air for 30 min. The pad temperature of the middle three digits \nwas measured.\nRESULTS: CIVD in water was more pronounced in the fingers (onset time 5.1 +\/- \n1.8 min; amplitude 5.0 +\/- 2.1 degrees C) than in the toes (onset time 10.6 +\/- \n6.0 min; amplitude 3.0 +\/- 1.0 degrees C). Out of 22 skin temperature responses \nto cold air, 13 were not identifiable as CIVD. The mean skin temperatures for \nfingers and toes during the last 20 min of cold exposure were 25.6 +\/- 7.1 \ndegrees C and 20.9 +\/- 6.8 degrees C, respectively, for air and 9.3 +\/- 1.9 \ndegrees C and 7.1 +\/- 1.3 degrees C for water immersion. There was a strong \nrelation between the mean temperature of the fingers during cold-water immersion \nand toes during cold air exposure (r = 0.83, P < 0.01), showing that a weak CIVD \nresponse in the hand is related to a weak response in the foot.\nDISCUSSION: We conclude that the cold-water finger immersion test is related to \nthe temperature response in the toes and may thus continue to serve as a valid \nindicator for the risk of local cold injuries.\n\nDOI: 10.3357\/asem.2258.2008\nPMID: 18856183 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Although ice-cold-water immersion will rapidly extract heat, access to \nice or cold water may be limited in hot climates. Indeed, some have concerns \nregarding the sudden cold-water immersion of hyperthermic individuals, whereas \nothers believe that cutaneous vasoconstriction may reduce convective heat \ntransfer from the core. It was hypothesized that warmer immersion temperatures, \nwhich induce less powerful vasoconstriction, may still facilitate rapid cooling \nin hyperthermic individuals.\nMETHODS: Eight males participated in three trials and were heated to an \nesophageal temperature of 39.5 degrees C by exercising in the heat (36 degrees \nC, 50% relative humidity) while wearing a water-perfusion garment (40 degrees \nC). Subjects were cooled using each of the following methods: air (20-22 degrees \nC), cold-water immersion (14 degrees C), and temperate-water immersion (26 \ndegrees C).\nRESULTS: The time to reach an esophageal temperature of 37.5 degrees C averaged \n22.81 min (air), 2.16 min (cold), and 2.91 min (temperate). Whereas each of the \nbetween-trial comparisons was statistically significant (P < 0.05), cooling in \ntemperate water took only marginally longer than that in cold water, and one \ncannot imagine that the 45-s cooling time difference would have any meaningful \nphysiological or clinical implications.\nCONCLUSION: It is assumed that this rapid heat loss was due to a less powerful \nperipheral vasoconstrictor response, with central heat being more rapidly \ntransported to the skin surface for dissipation. Although the core-to-water \nthermal gradient was much smaller with temperate-water cooling, greater skin and \ndeeper tissue blood flows would support a superior convective heat delivery. \nThus, a sustained physiological mechanism (blood flow) appears to have countered \na less powerful thermal gradient, resulting in clinically insignificant \ndifferences in heat extraction between the cold and temperate cooling trials.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/MSS.0b013e31817eee9d\nPMID: 18845977 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The basal ganglia play a role in processing pain. We hypothesized \nthat the plastic changes that lead to dyskinesia may also mediate pain \nresponses. Our objective was to compare the change in pain sensitivity after \nlevodopa administration between stable responders, fluctuators without \ndyskinesia, and dyskinetic patients, and to compare pain sensitivity between PD \nand healthy subjects. Fifty patients with PD were assessed with cold water \nimmersion after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic medications and again after \na standard levodopa challenge, and carefully classified into stable responder (n \n= 12), fluctuator (n = 15), and dyskinetic (n = 23) groups.

The use of the parameter mean sphered cell volume \n(MSCV), automatically measured by means of the Coulter LH750, could be useful \nfor diagnosing the presence of sport hemolysis. We studied the behavior of MSCV \nand mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in 30 top-level rugby players who underwent a \nheavy training session followed by 3 different recovery methods, administered to \n3 subgroups of 10 athletes. We tested the use of active recovery consisting of \ncold water (5 degrees C) immersion of legs for 10 minutes either before (n = 10) \nor after (n = 10) cycling at 180 W for 10 minutes. In the whole group of \nathletes, measurements performed at rest and after training session and recovery \nshowed no differences in MCV and MSCV values. The difference between MCV and \nMSCV was significant in the whole group and in the subgroup performing passive \nrecovery, whereas the difference was not significant in the subgroups performing \nactive recovery. This finding indicates that the use of active recovery in the \ntop-level rugby players prevented the modifications of erythrocyte volume and \nshape. We outline that the values of the difference between MCV and MSCV was \nsignificantly modified in the whole group but the variations were not \nsignificant in the active recovery subgroups. The use of an index of erythrocyte \nshape modification (MCV - MSCV) can be very useful for evaluating sport \nhemolysis.\n\nDOI: 10.1532\/LH96.08004\nPMID: 18599431 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Repeated sprint ability, strength, muscle soreness and inflammatory \nmarkers were measured across the 48-h post-exercise period. Eleven male \nteam-sport athletes completed three 3-day testing trials, each separated by 2 \nweeks.

Upon completion of the exercise, and 24h \nlater, participants performed one of the post-exercise recovery procedures for \n15 min. At 48 h post-exercise, the performance tests were repeated. Blood \nsamples and muscle soreness ratings were taken before and immediately after \npost-exercise, and at 24h and 48 h post-exercise. In comparison to the control \nand CWI treatments, COLD resulted in significantly lower (p<0.05) muscle \nsoreness ratings, as well as in reduced decrements to isometric leg extension \nand flexion strength in the 48-h post-exercise period. COLD also facilitated a \nmore rapid return to baseline repeated sprint performances. The only benefit of \nCWI over control was a significant reduction in muscle soreness 24h \npost-exercise.

While the CPT elicits strong \nsympathetic nervous system activation, cortisol elevations indicative for the \nreactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are moderate to low \nin response to the CPT.

While the \nstandard CPT and the socially evaluated cold-pressor test (SECPT) led to \ncomparable increases in blood pressure and subjective stress ratings, saliva \ncortisol elevations and the proportion of subjects showing a saliva cortisol \nresponse (defined as increase >2nmol\/l) were significantly higher after the \nSECPT. Social evaluation during hand immersion in warm water did not affect \nsaliva cortisol levels suggesting that both social evaluation and a challenge \nare required for HPA axis activation.

Psychological skills training \n(PST) can modify the responses evoked by thermal stimuli such as the respiratory \nresponses on immersion to cold water. This study tested the hypothesis that a \n4-d PST package would significantly increase the distance covered during 90 min \nof running in the heat.\nMETHOD: Eighteen subjects completed three maximal-effort runs (R1, R2, R3) of 90 \nmin in the heat (30 degrees C; 40% RH). After R2, subjects were matched and \nrandomly allocated to either a control group (CG) or psychological skills group \n(PSG). Between R2 and R3, the CG (N = 8) continued their normal activities, and \nthe PSG (N = 10) received PST to help them tolerate unpleasant sensations \narising from exercising in the heat, and to suppress the temptation to lower \ntheir work intensity. Key measures include distance covered, .VO2, skin (T(sk)) \nand aural temperature (T(au)), RPE, sweat production and evaporation, \ninterleukin-6 (IL-6), and prolactin (PRL) in whole blood.\nRESULTS: The distances covered in the CG did not differ between runs. In the \nPSG, there were no differences in the distance run between R1 and R2, but they \nran significantly farther in R3 (8%; 1.15 km); there were no between-group \ndifferences. There were no significant differences between R1 and R3 in peak \nT(au), T(sk), sweat volumes, IL-6, and PRL (P > 0.05) in either group.\nCONCLUSION: PST suppressed the temptation to reduce exercise intensity during \nR3. It is concluded that PST can improve running performance in the heat. The \nprecise mechanisms underpinning these improvements are unclear; however, their \nimplications for unblinded experimental design are not.\n\nDOI: 10.1249\/mss.0b013e31815adf31\nPMID: 18202561 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Two of the 10 patients who underwent testing were excluded \nfrom the analysis because they did not respond to the Cold Pressor Test (CPT). \nSystolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were measured \ncontinuously at the wrist (using the Vasotrac device). SCS was administered with \nquadripolar leads implanted into the epidural space under fluoroscopic guidance. \nSCS was randomly performed either in the T1-T2 or T5-T6 region of the spinal \ncord during normal conditions as well as during transient stress induced by CPT. \nThe CPT was conducted by immersing the non-dominant hand in ice-cold water for 2 \nminutes.\nRESULTS: There were moderate decreases in MAP and HR during SCS at the T5-T6 \nregion compared to baseline that did not reach statistical significance. \nHowever, SCS at the T1-T2 region tended to increase MAP and HR compared to \nbaseline but the change did not reach statistical significance. Arterial blood \npressure was transiently elevated by 9.4 +\/- 3.8 mmHg using CPT during the \ncontrol period with SCS turned off and also during SCS at either the T1-T2 \nregion or T5-T6 region of the spinal cord (by 9.2 +\/- 5 mmHg and 10.7 +\/- 8.4 \nmmHg, respectively).

However, \nduring transcient stress (elevated sympathetic tone) induced by CPT, there was a \nsignificant increase in MAP and moderate decrease in HR during SCS at T5-T6 \nregion, which is not consistent with previous data in the literature.

To test the hypothesis that gender might \naffect the contralateral vasoconstrictor response, we analyzed the \nspatiotemporal pattern of palm skin surface temperature during ice-water \nimmersion for 10 min using thermography in eight males and eight females. As \nsoon as the left hand was immersed in ice-water, palm skin temperature in the \nnonimmersed right hand quickly decreased in all subjects, particularly in the \nperiphery of the digits and palm. The reduction in skin temperature was \nshort-lasting in 63% of males and 38% of females, but it lasted throughout \nimmersion in the remaining subjects. The average decrease in palm skin \ntemperature was not significantly different between males and females, though it \ntended to be greater in males. The mean arterial blood pressure significantly \nincreased and heart rate decreased during immersion in males, whereas no \nsubstantial cardiovascular changes were observed in females. Cold sensation was \nwell coincident with the appearance of a reduction in the palm skin temperature. \nIn consideration of all these results, we suggest that cutaneous cold stimuli \nincreased skin sympathetic nerve activity in the nonimmersed hand and reduced \nskin blood flow. We also contend that gender difference in the contralateral \nvasoconstrictor response was denied because the time course and magnitude of the \ndecrease in palm skin temperature were not different between males and females.\n\nDOI: 10.2170\/physiolsci.RP007707\nPMID: 17854512 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Tiina.Jaaniste@sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au\n\nThis experimental study investigated whether preparatory sensory information was \nmore effective in managing children's pain when coupled with a distraction \ntechnique. Seventy-eight children aged 7-12 years were randomly allocated to 1 \nof 4 experimental conditions. They were given either a detailed sensory \ndescription of an imminent painful event (cold-pressor arm immersion in 10 \ndegrees C water) or control instructions lacking sensory information. During the \ncold-pressor task, half the sample received an imagery-based distraction \nintervention. Pain measures included immersion tolerance, self-reported pain \nintensity, and facial pain responses. Self-reported coping style was assessed \nusing the Pain Coping Questionnaire [Reid, G. J., Gilbert, C. A., & McGrath, P. \nJ. (1998). The pain coping questionnaire: Preliminary validation. Pain, 76, \n83-96]. The effects of information provision interacted with distraction for \npain intensity but not pain tolerance. Children given sensory preparation \nreported less intense pain when this was coupled with distraction than when it \nwas not. Children with a distraction-based coping style showed greater tolerance \nwhen assigned to a condition congruent with their coping style. These findings \nsuggest ways to better prepare children for painful medical procedures.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.brat.2007.07.005\nPMID: 17727813 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty males (mean age 22.3 years, s = 3.3; height 1.80 \nm, s = 0.05; body mass 83.7 kg, s = 11.9) completed a 90-min intermittent \nshuttle run previously shown to result in marked muscle damage and soreness. \nAfter exercise, participants were randomly assigned to either 10 min cold-water \nimmersion (mean 10 degrees C, s = 0.5) or a non-immersion control group. Ratings \nof perceived soreness, changes in muscular function and efflux of intracellular \nproteins were monitored before exercise, during treatment, and at regular \nintervals up to 7 days post-exercise. Exercise resulted in severe muscle \nsoreness, temporary muscular dysfunction, and elevated serum markers of muscle \ndamage, all peaking within 48 h after exercise. Cryotherapy administered \nimmediately after exercise reduced muscle soreness at 1, 24, and 48 h (P < \n0.05). Decrements in isometric maximal voluntary contraction of the knee flexors \nwere reduced after cryotherapy treatment at 24 (mean 12%, s(x) = 4) and 48 h \n(mean 3%, s(x) = 3) compared with the control group (mean 21%, s(x) = 5 and mean \n14%, s(x) = 5 respectively; P < 0.05).

Self-reported \ntension (p<.01), depression (p<.05) and confusion (p<.01) also increased in the \ncold. When volunteers consumed TYR, correct responses increased on a \nMatch-to-Sample memory measure (p<.05) and study time for the sample was shorter \n(p<.05), indicative of more rapid and accurate information processing. Finally, \nRT on the memory measure revealed a similar pattern across immersions for TYR \nand thermoneutral conditions, but not cold\/placebo (p<.05).

They also completed a control trial \n(120 min rest in 19 degrees C air). Immediately following each CWI and control, \ncognitive and physical performance tests were performed in cold air (10 degrees \nC; CAE).\nRESULTS: Overall, the CWI protocol lowered rectal temperature by 0.3-1.0 degrees \nC. Mean skin temperature was approximately 26 degrees C and finger temperature \nwas approximately 15 degrees C during CAE. No statistical differences were \nobserved across trials for any cognitive test. On the physical performance \ntests, step test performance was degraded approximately 12% on CWI trials \ncompared with control, but there were no differences in manual dexterity, hand \ngrip strength, marksmanship, or pull-ups.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cognitive performance can be maintained \ndespite mild hypothermia, and that physical performance is related to local \ntissue temperature, not a moderately reduced core temperature.\n\nPMID: 17571656 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

H.Morton@massey.ac.nz\n\nThe benefits of rapid recovery after intense exercise are widely recognised, and \nlactate elimination is one indicator of recovery rate. This study examined the \neffect of contrast (alternating hot and cold) water immersion (CWI) on the rate \nof plasma lactate decrease during recovery after intense anaerobic exercise. \nEleven subjects on each of two occasions undertook four successive 30-s Wingate \ntests separated by 30-s rest periods. On each occasion, plasma lactate \nconcentration during recovery was measured 5 min post-exercise and thereafter at \n5 min intervals for 30 min. On one occasion (determined randomly), the subjects \nrecovered passively (PR) on a recovery bed and, on the other, they alternated \npartial body immersion in hot (36 degrees C) and cold (12 degrees C) water \nbaths. Plasma lactate concentrations were analysed by repeated measures analysis \nof variance and by fitting a linear regression model, allowing for both gender \nand recovery mode differences. The rate of decrease in plasma lactate \nconcentration over the 30-min recovery period was significantly higher (p<0.001) \nin CWI; 0.28(+\/-0.02) mmol L(-1) min(-1) (CWI) compared to 0.22(+\/-0.02) mmol \nL(-1) min(-1) (PR). These values do not differ significantly between males and \nfemales. Contrast water immersion is a valid method of hastening plasma lactate \ndecrease during recovery after intense anaerobic exercise for both males and \nfemales. An approximately 1.8 mmol L(-1) difference between the two conditions \nmay be expected after 30 min. With differences among elite competitors as little \nas 1-2%, this reduction may be of practical significance.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.jsams.2006.09.004\nPMID: 17118706 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In study 1, ATmax, heart rate (HR) and cutaneous blood cell \nvelocity were measured in 13 non-apnoea-trained males during apnoeic face \nimmersion in 0, 10, 20 and 33 degrees C water and room air (AIR). In study 2, \nsix males were measured during non-apnoeic face immersion in 0, 10 and 33 \ndegrees C water for ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), HR and \noxygen consumption (VO2), as well for end-tidal partial pressures of oxygen \n(PET,O2) and carbon dioxide (PET,CO2). Results indicated that the ATmax of 30.7 \ns (S.D. 7.1 s) at 0 degrees C (P < 0.001) and 48.2 s (S.D. 16.0 s) at 10 degrees \nC (P < 0.05) were significantly shorter than that of 58 s in AIR or 33 degrees \nC. During apnoea at 0, 10, 20 and 33 degrees C, both the deceleration of HR (P < \n0.05) and peripheral vasoconstriction (P < 0.05), as well as the peak HR at 0 \ndegrees C (P = 0.002) were significantly greater than in AIR. At 0 degrees C in \ncomparison with 33 degrees C, non-apnoeic face immersions gave peaks in (P = \n0.039), RER (P = 0.025), (P = 0.032) and HR (P = 0.011), as well as lower \nminimum values for (P = 0.033) and HR (P = 0.002).

The marked reduction in \nmaximal breath-hold time associated with CWI, part of the 'cold shock' response, \nsignificantly increases the risk of drowning. However, the response is highly \nvariable between subjects. This experiment tested the hypothesis that part of \nthis variability is due to psychological factors.\nMETHODS: There were 32 subjects who completed 2 2.5-min, head-out immersions in \n11 degrees C water, separated by 7 d. Between immersions, subjects were matched \non initial maximum breath-hold time on immersion (BHwater) and allocated to \neither a psychological intervention group (PIG) or control group (CG). PIG \n(n=16) subjects each undertook a psychological skills intervention comprising 4 \ninterlinked training sessions covering goal-setting, arousal regulation, mental \nimagery, and positive self-talk; CG (n=16) continued normal daily activity.\nRESULTS: Psychological intervention significantly increased BHwater on immersion \nin the PIG vs. the CG [mean (SD); CG BHwater immersion 1:24.01 (6.72) s; \nimmersion 2: 21.34 (16.31) s; PIG: BHwater immersion 1: 24.66 (14.60) s; \nimmersion 2: 44.25 (31.63) s]. The difference in maximum voluntary BHwater \nbetween immersion 1 and 2 in the PIG averaged 19.59 s, equating to an 80% \nincrease following psychological intervention.\nCONCLUSION: Psychological influences may account for a significant amount of the \nvariability in the respiratory responses during CWI, and may be a key factor in \ndetermining the chances of survival following accidental immersion.\n\nPMID: 17086766 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The effectiveness of tyrosine for \npreventing cold-induced decreases in physical performance has not been examined. \nThis study evaluated the effect of tyrosine supplementation on cognitive, \npsychomotor, and physical performance following a cold water immersion protocol \nthat lowered body core temperature. Fifteen subjects completed a control trial \n(CON) in warm (35 degrees C) water and two cold water trials, each spaced a week \napart. Subjects ingested an energy bar during each trial; on one cold trial \n(TYR) the bar contained tyrosine (300 mg\/kg body weight), and on the other cold \ntrial (PLB) and on CON the bar contained no tyrosine. Following each water \nimmersion, subjects completed a battery of performance tasks in a cold air (10 \ndegrees C) chamber. Core temperature was lower (p=0.0001) on PLB and TYR (both \n35.5+\/-0.6 degrees C) than CON (37.1+\/-0.3 degrees C). On PLB, performance on a \nMatch-to-Sample task decreased 18% (p=0.02) and marksmanship performance \ndecreased 14% (p=0.002), compared to CON, but there was no difference between \nTYR and CON.

Total \ninsulation and tissue insulation were estimated by dividing the temperature \ndifference between the esophagus and the water or the esophagus and the skin \nwith heat loss from the skin. Esophageal temperature with a thermal swimsuit was \nhigher than that with a normal swimsuit at the end of immersion in both water \ntemperature conditions (p<0.05). Oxygen consumption, metabolic heat production \nand heat loss from the skin were less with the thermal swimsuit than with a \nnormal swimsuit in both water temperatures (p<0.05). Total insulation with the \nthermal swimsuit was higher than that with a normal swimsuit due to insulation \nof the suit at both water temperatures (p<0.05).

This was done by comparing changes \nin peripheral circulation, measured indirectly by monitoring changes in skin \nsurface temperatures of the hand with both infrared (IR) thermography and \nthermocouples before, during and after immersing the right hand for 2 min in \nwater at 10 degrees C. Included in the study were young male non-smokers (n = \n14) and smokers (n = 13), and elderly non-smokers (n = 12) and smokers (n = 14). \nThe results showed no statistically significant difference between young \nnon-smokers and smokers when comparing their response to the local cold \nchallenge. The elderly smokers had a significantly higher hand skin temperature \nprior to cooling (34.0 +\/- 0.2 degrees C) and after 80% rewarming (32.1 +\/- 0.2 \ndegrees C) (i.e. when the skin temperature in the \"cooled\" hand has regained 80% \nof the cold induced drop in temperature), compared to elderly non-smokers (33.3 \n+\/- 0.2 and 31.3 +\/- 0.2 degrees C, respectively). The elderly smoking subjects \nalso had a faster recovery after cooling (9.7 +\/- 0.8 min) than the elderly \nnon-smoking subjects (16.7 +\/- 2.6 min). A follow-up study with seven elderly \nsmokers, who had smoked as usual until 2 h before the experiment, showed \nresponses lying between the non-smokers and smokers who had had a longer period \nof abstinence (12 h) from smoking. In conclusion, we have demonstrated using \nIR-thermal imaging that elderly subjects who have smoked for many years have \nslightly warmer hand skin temperature when they abstain from smoking. Even a \nperiod of abstinence from smoking of a few hours can affect the way in which \nelderly subjects respond to a local cold challenge, recovering more rapidly then \ntheir non-smoking counterparts.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-006-0261-2\nPMID: 16874507 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The present study tested the hypothesis that a more \nprofound cold stimulus would override the MS effect on peripheral \nvasoconstriction and hence on the core cooling rate. Eleven healthy subjects \nunderwent two separate head-out immersions in 15 degrees C water. In the control \ntrial (CN), subjects were immersed after baseline measurements. In the MS-trial, \nsubjects were rendered motion sick prior to immersion, by using a rotating chair \nin combination with a regimen of standardized head movements. During immersion \nin the MS-trial, subjects were exposed to an optokinetic stimulus (rotating \ndrum). At 5-min intervals subjects rated their temperature perception, thermal \ncomfort and MS discomfort. During immersion mean skin temperature, rectal \ntemperature, the difference in temperature between the non-immersed right \nforearm and 3rd finger of the right hand (DeltaTff), oxygen uptake and heart \nrate were recorded. In the MS-trial, rectal temperature decreased substantially \nfaster (33%, P < 0.01). Also, the DeltaTff response, an index of peripheral \nvasomotor tone, as well as the oxygen uptake, indicative of the shivering \nresponse, were significantly attenuated (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) \nby MS. Thus, MS may predispose individuals to hypothermia by enhancing heat loss \nand attenuating heat production. This might have significant implications for \nsurvival in maritime accidents.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-006-0217-6\nPMID: 16847677 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

However, the impact of consecutive maximal breath holds on \ncentral hemodynamics in the postapneic period is unknown. Eight trained apnea \ndivers and eight control subjects performed five successive maximal apneas, \nseparated by a 2-min resting interval, with face immersion in cold water. \nUltrasound examinations of inferior vena cava (IVC) and the heart were carried \nout at times 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min after the last apnea. The arterial oxygen \nsaturation level and blood pressure, heart rate, and transcutaneous partial \npressures of CO(2) and O(2) were monitored continuously. At 20 min after breath \nholds, IVC diameter increased (27.6 and 16.8% for apnea divers and controls, \nrespectively). Subsequently, pulmonary vascular resistance increased and cardiac \noutput decreased both in apnea divers (62.8 and 21.4%, respectively) and the \ncontrol group (74.6 and 17.8%, respectively). Cardiac output decrements were due \nto reductions in stroke volumes in the presence of reduced end-diastolic \nventricular volumes. Transcutaneous partial pressure of CO(2) increased in all \nparticipants during breath holding, returned to baseline between apneas, but \nremained slightly elevated during the postdive observation period (approximately \n4.5%). Thus increased right ventricular afterload and decreased cardiac output \nwere associated with CO(2) retention and signs of peripheralization of blood \nvolume. These results indicate that repeated apneas may cause prolonged \nhemodynamic changes after resumption of normal breathing, which may suggest what \nhappens in sleep apnea syndrome.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.00759.2005\nPMID: 16728515 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The aim of this study was to determine whether the endogenous pain \ninhibitory systems recruited by the spatial summation model are opioid-mediated \nby verifying if they could be blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone. Twenty \nhealthy volunteers (10 men, 10 women) participated in a randomized, \nfour-session, cross-over study. Each session consisted of pain perception \nratings (visual analog scale) taken during the immersion of different surfaces \nof the arm in circulating noxious cold water (12 degrees C). The arm was \narbitrarily divided into eight segments from fingertips to shoulder. Two \nsessions were increasing (from fingertips to shoulder) and two sessions were \ndecreasing (from shoulder to fingertips). All sessions consisted of eight \nconsecutive 2-min immersions separated by 5-min resting periods. Intravenous \ninjections of naloxone hydrochloride (0.14 mg\/kg) or saline (NaCl, 0.9%) were \nadministered under double-blind conditions. We found that during the control \nsession (saline injection) there was a significant difference in pain intensity \nratings between the increasing and decreasing sessions. The decreasing session \nresulted in lower pain intensity. As previously demonstrated, this lowering of \nthe perception curve seems to be due to a large recruitment of inhibitory \nsystems at the beginning of the decreasing session as opposed to a gradual \nrecruitment during the increasing session. However, during the opioid inhibition \nsession (naloxone injection) no differences were found between the increasing \nand decreasing sessions. Naloxone inhibited the endogenous pain inhibitory \nsystems activated by the spatial summation model, suggesting that these systems \nhave an opioid-mediated component, as previously reported for diffuse noxious \ninhibitory controls.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.neulet.2006.03.032\nPMID: 16600506 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After LCA the initial \nskin temperature decrease tended to be lower, indicating reduced \nvasoconstriction. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure appeared to be \ngenerally lower during rest and during the time course of cooling in LCA humans, \nwhen compared to controls. All these changes seem to indicate attenuation of the \nsympathetic tone. In contrast, the sustained skin temperature in different areas \nof the body (finger, palm, forearm, thigh, chest) appeared to be generally lower \nin LCA subjects than in controls (except for temperatures on the forehead). \nPlasma levels of catecholamines (measured 20 and 40 min after the onset of \ncooling) were also not influenced by local cold adaptation. Locally cold adapted \nsubjects, when exposed to whole body cold water immersion test, showed no change \nin the threshold temperature for induction of cold thermogenesis. This indicates \nthat the hypothermic type of cold adaptation, typically occurring after systemic \ncold adaptation, does not appear after local cold adaptation of the intensity \nused. It is concluded that in humans the cold adaptation due to repeated local \ncooling of legs induces different physiological changes than systemic cold \nadaptation.\n\nDOI: 10.33549\/physiolres.930825\nPMID: 16343045 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twelve male team-sport players completed four cycling \nintermittent sprint protocols (CISP). Each CISP consisted of twenty 2-min \nperiods, each including 10 s of passive rest, 5 s of maximal sprint against a \nresistance of 7.5% body mass, and 105 s of active recovery. The CISP, preceded \nby 20 min of no cooling (Control), precooling via an ice vest (Vest), cold water \nimmersion (Water), and ice packs covering the upper legs (Packs), was performed \nin hot, humid conditions (mean +\/- SE; 33.7 +\/- 0.3 degrees C, 51.6 +\/- 2.2% \nrelative humidity) in a randomized order. The rate of heat strain increase \nduring the CISP was faster in Control than Water and Packs (P < 0.01), but it \nwas similar to Vest. Packs and Water blunted the rise of Tmu until minute 16 and \nfor the duration of the CISP (40 min), respectively (P < 0.01). Reductions in \nPPO occurred from minute 32 onward in Control, and an increase in PPO by \napproximately 4% due to Packs was observed (main effect; P < 0.05). The method \nof precooling determined the extent to which heat strain was reduced during \nintermittent sprint cycling, with leg precooling offering the greater ergogenic \neffect on PPO than either upper body or whole body cooling.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.00822.2005\nPMID: 16339344 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Because hypohydration is \nassociated with reduced physical performance, strategies for maintaining \nhydration during CAE are important. Glycerol ingestion (GI) can induce \nhyperhydration in hot and temperate environments, resulting in greater fluid \nretention compared with water (WI) alone, but it is not effective during \ncold-water immersion. Water immersion induces a greater natriuresis and diuresis \nthan cold exposure; therefore, whether GI might be effective for hyperhydration \nduring CAE remains unknown. This study examined physiological responses, i.e., \nthermoregulatory, cardiovascular, renal, vascular fluid, and fluid-regulating \nhormonal responses, to GI in seven men during 4 h CAE (15 degrees C, 30% \nrelative humidity). Subjects completed three separate, double-blind, and \ncounterbalanced trials including WI (37 ml water\/l total body water), GI (37 ml \nwater\/l total body water plus 1.5 g glycerol\/l total body water), and no fluid. \nFluids were ingested 30 min before CAE. Thermoregulatory responses to cold were \nsimilar during each trial. Urine flow rates were higher (P = 0.0001) with WI \n(peak 11.8 ml\/min, SD 1.9) than GI (5.0 ml\/min, SD 1.8), and fluid retention was \ngreater (P = 0.0001) with GI (34%, SD 7) than WI (18%, SD 5) at the end of CAE. \nDifferences in urine flow rate and fluid retention were the result of a greater \nfree water clearance with WI. These data indicate glycerol can be an effective \nhyperhydrating agent during CAE.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.00176.2005\nPMID: 15817723 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We have previously \nshown that raising nasal mucosal temperature by immersing feet in warm water \nincreases the amount of water evaporated by the nose as air passes through it \n(nasal conditioning capacity; Abbott D, Baroody F, Naureckas E, and Naclerio R. \nAm J Rhinol 15: 41-45, 2001). To investigate further the effect of nasal mucosal \ntemperature on nasal conditioning capacity, we raised the temperature through \nalpha-adrenoreceptor blockade by intranasally administering phenoxybenzamine. We \nhypothesized that blocking alpha-adrenoreceptors during inhalation of cold, dry \nair would lead to an increase in nasal blood flow, surface temperature, and \nnasal conditioning capacity, as measured by the water gradient. After \nappropriate pilot studies, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, \ntwo-way crossover study in nine nonatopic, healthy subjects by studying the \neffect of treatment with intranasal phenoxybenzamine. Nasal mucosal temperature \nincreased significantly after administration of phenoxybenzamine and was \nassociated with a significantly smaller net decrease in nasal mucosal \ntemperature after exposure to cold, dry air (P < 0.05). However, there were no \nsignificant differences in nasal conditioning capacity between treatments (P > \n0.05).

During isometric contraction, the maximal \nelongation of the tendon was significantly greater than that of the aponeurosis. \nAfter cooling and heating, no significant changes in the elongation of muscle \nfascicle, tendon and aponeurosis were found during passive stretch. Similarly, \nafter both the immersions there were no changes in the relationship between the \nestimated muscle force and elongation of each structure (tendon-aponeurosis \ncomplex, tendon) during isometric contraction.\nINTERPRETATION: These results implied that the general application of icing and \nhot pack did not change the mechanical properties of muscle and tendon.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.clinbiomech.2004.11.005\nPMID: 15698702 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

On one \noccasion subjects experienced up to 15 min of optokinetic stimulation, followed \nby three 30-s applications of ice to the temple at 4-min intervals. On another \noccasion, the ice applications preceded and accompanied optokinetic stimulation. \nOn a third occasion, one hand was immersed in ice water for 30 s, three times at \n4-min intervals before and during optokinetic stimulation. Subjects recorded \nheadache activity in a diary over the course of the study. None of the controls \nexperienced a migraine-like attack at any stage of the experiment. In migraine \nsufferers, the incidence of migraine-like attacks was greater than the expected \ndaily incidence of 8% after sessions that involved painful stimulation of the \ntemple during or after optokinetic stimulation (44% and 28% of the group, \nrespectively) (P<0.001). In contrast, migraine-like attacks developed in only \n13% of migraine sufferers after the session that involved immersing the hand in \nice water during optokinetic stimulation (not significant). The development of \nnausea and headache during optokinetic stimulation increased the likelihood of \nmigraine-like attacks afterwards. These findings indicate that motion sickness \nand head pain increase susceptibility to migrainous attacks in migraine \nsufferers, and suggest that the symptoms of migraine build upon each other in a \nvicious circle. Thus, targeting multiple symptoms should be more effective than \ntargeting individual symptoms, both for preventing and treating attacks of \nmigraine.\n\nDOI: 10.1111\/j.1468-2982.2004.00844.x\nPMID: 15689198 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The CIVD response varies \nbetween individuals, but the within-subject reproducibility has not been \nadequately described. The purpose of this study was to quantify the \nwithin-subject variability in the CIVD response under standardized conditions. \nTwenty-one volunteers resting in a controlled environment (27 degrees C) \nimmersed the middle finger in warm water (42 degrees C) for 15 min to \nstandardize initial finger temperature and then in cold water (4 degrees C; CWI) \nfor 30 min, on five separate occasions. Skin temperature (Tf) and blood flow \n(laser-Doppler; expressed as percent change from warm-water peak) responses that \ndescribe CIVD were identified, including initial nadir reached during CWI, onset \ntime of CIVD, initial apex during CIVD, time of that apex, and overall mean \nduring CWI. Within-subject coefficient of variation for Tf across the five tests \nfor the nail bed and pad, respectively, were as follows: nadir, 9 and 21%; \nonset, 18 and 19%; apex, 12 and 17%; apex time, 23 and 24%; mean 10 and 15%. For \nblood flow, these values were as follows: nadir 52 and 64%; onset, 6 and 5%; \napex, 33 and 31%; apex time 9 and 8%; and mean 43 and 34%. Greater variability \nwas found in the temperature response of the finger pad than the nail bed, but \nfor blood flow the variability was similar between locations. Variability in \nonset and apex time between sites was similar for both temperature and blood \nflow responses. The reproducibility of the time course of CIVD suggests this \nmethodology may be of value for further studies examining the mechanism of the \nresponse.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.00859.2004\nPMID: 15579576 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Recordings were obtained from 36 healthy adults \n(16 M, 20 F), and the area and temporal summation threshold (TST) of the RIII \nreflex were measured. The subjective intensity of the painful sensation was \nrated on an 11-point visual analogue scale (VAS). Neurophysiological and VAS \nmeasurements were recorded after activation of DNICs by means of the cold \npressor test (CPT), which involved immersing the hand in cold water (2-4 degrees \nC). A slight significant lower TST was found in the females versus the males. In \nall the subjects, the CPT induced a significant TST increase and RIII area \nreduction compared with the control session. The VAS results paralleled those of \nthe RIII reflex area and TST. During the CPT, a significant difference in the \npercentage TST increase emerged between females and males, being lower in the \nformer. Similarly, we found a significantly lower percentage reduction of the \nRIII area in women than in men during the CPT. To summarize, activation of DNICs \nthrough the CPT significantly increased the TST of the RIII reflex in healthy \nsubjects. This inhibitory effect was gender-specific. Whereas other findings are \nbased on psychophysical evaluations, the results of this experimental study \nprovide an objective neurophysiological demonstration that DNICs attenuate \ntemporal summation in humans and confirm the presence of significant differences \nin pain modulation mechanisms between men and women.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.pain.2004.09.018\nPMID: 15561391 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Subjects were then immersed in 7 degrees C water to \na Tes of 34.5 degrees C.\nRESULTS: Initial Tes cooling rates (initial approximately 6 min cooling) \ndiffered significantly among the treatment conditions (0.074 +\/- 0.045, 0.129 \n+\/- 0.076, and 0.348 +\/- 0.117 degrees C x min(-1) for control, active, and \npassive warming conditions, respectively); however, secondary cooling rates \n(rates following initial approximately 6 min cooling to the end of immersion) \nwere not different between treatments (average of 0.102 +\/- 0.085 degrees C x \nmin(-1)).

Oral medication and other \nmodalities such as heat, cold, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and surgery \n(neuro-surgical or orthopedic) can also be used. The aim of this study was to \ncompare the effects of hydrotherapy on spasticity and Functional Independence \nMeasure (FIM) scores of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a control case matched study. Twenty SCI patients \nwere divided into 2 groups and matched for age, gender, injury time, Ashworth \nscores, oral baclofen intake, American Spinal Injury Association, and FIM \nscores. The control group received passive range of motion exercise twice a day \nand oral baclofen for 10 weeks. The study group also received passive range of \nmotion and oral baclofen, as well as 20 min of water exercises (at 71 degrees F, \nfull immersion) 3 times per week. The authors evaluated spasm severity, FIM \nscores, oral baclofen intake, and Ashworth scales, between groups at the \nbeginning and at the end of the treatment period.\nRESULTS: Both groups demonstrated a significant increase in FIM scores. However, \nthe hydrotherapy group demonstrated a larger increase (P < 0.0001) than the \ncontrol group. There was a statistically significant decrease in oral baclofen \nintake in the hydrotherapy group (P < 0.01). There was no statistical change in \nthe control group. Spasticity was evaluated by the Ashworth scale. There was a \nstatistical improvement in each group (P < 0.01, P < 0.02). However, when \ncompared to the control group, the use of hydrotherapy produced a significant \ndecrease in spasm severity (P < 0.02).\nCONCLUSION: Side effects are often seen when using oral drug treatment for \nspasticity. Adding hydrotherapy to the rehabilitation program can be helpful in \ndecreasing the amount of medication required. Future studies must evaluate \nbenefits of hydrotherapy for rehabilitation.\n\nDOI: 10.1177\/1545968304270002\nPMID: 15537997 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Following 40 min \nof ergometer cycling [65% peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak))] at 35 degrees C (Ex. \n1), seven male subjects [21.9 (1.1) years of age; 170.9 (1.9) cm height; 66.0 \n(2.0) kg body mass; 46.7 (2.0) ml kg(-1) min(-1) VO(2peak)] immersed their legs \nin 35 degrees C (control condition, CONT) or 20 degrees C (cooling condition, \nCOOL) water for 5 min and then repeated the cycling (as before, but for 10 min) \n(Ex. 2). Just before Ex. 2, esophageal temperature ( T(es)) was lower in COOL \nthan in CONT [36.9 (0.2) vs 37.5 (0.1) degrees C] ( P<0.01), as also were both \nmean skin temperature [33.9 (0.2) vs 35.2 (0.2) degrees C] ( P<0.01), and heart \nrate (HR) [93.2 (6.0) vs 102.7 (4.9) beats min(-1)] ( P<0.05). During Ex. 2, no \ndifferences between CONT and COOL were observed in oxygen uptake, arterial blood \npressure, blood lactate concentration, or ratings of perceived exertion; \nhowever, T(es), skin temperature, and HR were lower in COOL than in CONT. \nFurther, during the first 5 min of Ex. 2, minute ventilation was significantly \nlower in COOL than in CONT [50.3 (2.0) vs 53.4 (2.6) l min(-1)] ( P<0.01).

A survey of previous \nstudies using the cold pressor, however, revealed a lack of standardization and \ncontrol of water temperature, questioning comparability and reliability. This \nstudy reports the influence of temperature on pain tolerance and intensity by \nusing a commercially available circulating water bath. Twenty-six participants \n(12 men, 14 women) underwent 4 cold pressor trials with temperature order \ncounterbalanced across 1 degrees C, 3 degrees C, 5 degrees C, and 7 degrees C, \ntemperatures representative of the range used in previous literature. After each \ncold immersion participants rated pain intensity on a visual analogue scale and \nthe McGill Pain Questionnaire. Tolerance times were recorded for each trial. \nSignificant main effects of temperature were found for tolerance time, with \nhigher temperatures resulting in longer times, and pain intensity, with lower \ntemperatures resulting in higher intensities. Gender differences were found, \nwith men tolerating the stimulus for significantly longer than women. It was \nconcluded that small differences in water temperature have a significant effect \non pain intensity and tolerance time. The use of cold pressor equipment that \nensures a precise constant temperature of circulating water is necessary to \nensure comparable and reliable results.\nPERSPECTIVE: The cold pressor method of experimental pain induction has been \nwidely used in the evaluation of psychological and physiological pain \ntreatments. This article highlights the need for clear methodologic guidelines \nfor the technique and demonstrates that very minor changes in experimental \nprotocol can produce significant differences.\n\nCopyright 2004 American Pain Society\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.jpain.2004.03.004\nPMID: 15162346 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The aim of this study was \nto ascertain whether 99mTc sestamibi scintigraphy is useful in the diagnosis and \nthe monitoring of treatment in VRS.\nMETHODS: Fifteen patients with VRS and 20 matched normal controls underwent \nexamination. Twelve patients with VRS received therapy. For each patient, one \nhand was immersed in iced water for 30s while the other hand served as a \ncontrol. Ten minutes after cooling, 99mTc sestamibi was injected and imaging was \nperformed 60min later. The per cent decrease of the perfusion (%DP) was \ncalculated by semiquantitative analysis to determine the severity of \nhypoperfusion.\nRESULTS: In all patients with VRS, moderate or marked hypoperfusion were seen in \n99mTc sestamibi images after exposure to the iced water, while there was minimal \nor mild hypoperfusion in the control groups. Values for %DP were 46.86 +\/- 19.04 \nand 7.85 +\/- 4.53 for the VRS group and normal subjects, respectively. The \ndifference between both groups was statistically significant (P = 0.0000). In 12 \ntreated patients with VRS, pre-treatment and post-treatment %DP values were \n51.16 +\/- 18.42 and 33.58 +\/- 17.83, respectively, and a significant difference \nwas seen between both values (P = 0.001). However, there was still a \nstatistically significant difference between control subjects and post-therapy \nvalues (7.85 +\/- 4.53 vs. 33.58 +\/- 17.83, P = 0.0000). The +\/- 95% confidence \ninterval of DP for control subjects was 5.7-10% (chi-squared, P = 0.000). When a \nDP of 10% was used as a cut-off point, sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic \naccuracy were 100%, 70% and 83%, respectively, for the 99mTc sestamibi scan. \nThere was also a strong correlation between %DP and the duration of the disease \n(r = 0.80, P = 0.0003).\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that a 99mTc sestamibi scan is a \nvaluable imaging method for the determination of digital ischaemia in \nvasospastic Raynaud's syndrome, and may play a role in evaluating the response \nto therapy.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/00006231-200402000-00019\nPMID: 15154713 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Fourteen males performed two pairs of treadmill runs to \nexhaustion at 120% and 90% of peak running speed (PRS) over a 4-hour period. \nACT, PAS or CTW was performed for 15-min after the first pair of treadmill runs. \nACT consisted of running at 40% PRS, PAS consisted of standing stationary and \nCTW consisted of alternating between 60-s cold (10 degrees C) and 120-s hot (42 \ndegrees C) water immersion. Run times were converted to time to cover set \ndistance using critical power.

Post exercise blood lactate concentration was lower in \nACT and CTW compared with PAS. Participants reported an increased perception of \nrecovery in the CTW compared with ACT and PAS. Blood pH was not significantly \ninfluenced by recovery modality.

In vivo immersions were conducted over 15 days (60-90 \nmin at 18 degrees C). Regional body temperatures and plasma leptin \nconcentrations were measured before and during immersion. Acute cold exposure \nsuppressed plasma leptin concentration (25 min: -14%, 60 min: -22%, P=0.0001), \nwhilst repeated cold-water immersion was associated with an increase of plasma \nleptin concentration relative to test day 1 (+19% day 8, +13% day 15, overall \nP=0.03). Leptin secretion in vitro decreased 3.7-fold as the incubation \ntemperature decreased from 37 degrees to 27 degrees C ( P=0.001). In a \ncompartmental model of leptin turnover in vivo, the measured (local) temperature \neffect on leptin secretion in vitro was more than able to account for the \nobserved cold-induced decrease in leptin concentration in vivo. We therefore \nconclude that acute and repeated cold-water immersions have separate and \nopposing effects on circulating leptin concentrations in humans. Under our \nexperimental conditions, the local effects of reduced subcutaneous adipose \ntissue temperature may be a more important contributor to the acute effects \nobserved in vivo, than the sympathetically mediated suppression of leptin \nsecretion.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-004-1084-7\nPMID: 15045507 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

ESB at level T2 provoked significantly faster \nrewarming as compared to T3 at the 2 day and 3 month follow-up. Independent of \nthe level of ESB, there was a slower rewarming in women already pre-operatively. \nThis gender difference was clearly reduced at the 2 day follow-up, but had \nincreased again at the 3 month follow-up.

We aimed to study the time course of impairment of manual \ndexterity during the initial stages of immersion.\nMETHODS: We investigated gross (manipulating harness buckles) and fine (Purdue \nPegboard Assembly) manual dexterity of 11 male and 15 female subjects with \neither no immersion (Control) or after immersion of right and left hand and \nforearm in 10 degrees C water for 30, 120, and 300 s.

The purpose of the present study was to examine sex \ndifferences in subjective pain and cortisol response to a noxious stressor.\nMETHODS: Seventy-six subjects (39 male and 37 female) were investigated by a \nmodification of the cold pressor test that consisted of intermittent immersion \nof the hand into ice water (plunge test, PT). The PT was conducted twice, in \nconsecutive trials, to guarantee a sufficient exposure to the noxious stressor \nfor eliciting cortisol responses. In each trial, tolerance time and pain ratings \nvisual analog scale (VAS) were assessed. Seven saliva samples (c1-c7) were \ncollected to determine cortisol levels at baseline (c1-c2), directly before (c3) \nand 20 minutes after noxious stress (c4), and during recovery period (c5-c7).\nRESULTS: We found no significant sex differences in tolerance time in trial 1, \nbut highly significant differences in tolerance time in trial 2, with higher \ntolerance times in men. No significant sex differences were found for the VAS \nratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness in the 2 trials. In contrast, a \nsignificantly larger cortisol increase in men was observed compared with women. \nAnalysis of covariance revealed that this result could not be attributed to sex \ndifferences in cortisol level at baseline and in tolerance time.\nDISCUSSION: The present study demonstrates that men show a larger cortisol \nresponse to a noxious stressor than women that is not attributable to sex \ndifferences in subjective pain. The conclusion of a causal relation between \nlarger cortisol responses and higher pain tolerance thresholds in men is \ntempting but yet speculative.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/00002508-200307000-00006\nPMID: 12840617 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Cardiorespiratory and sympathetic variables were collected \nat baseline and at plasma concentrations of remifentanil (2 and 4 ng\/mL). \nMonitoring included electrocardiogram, heart rate (HR), direct blood pressure, \nmuscle sympathetic nerve activity, and forearm blood flow (FBF). A cold pressor \ntest (1-min hand immersion in ice water) quantified analgesia effectiveness \n(visual analog scale, 0-100).

This phenomenon is \nexplained through a theoretical analysis of heat distribution in the body \napplied to an experiment involving cold water immersion. Six healthy and fit men \n(mean +\/- SD of age = 37.5 +\/- 6.5 yr, height = 1.79 +\/- 0.07 m, mass = 81.8 +\/- \n9.5 kg, body fat = 17.3 +\/- 4.2%, maximal O2 uptake = 46.9 +\/- 5.5 l\/min) were \nimmersed in water ranging from 16.4 to 24.1 degrees C for up to 10 h. Core \ntemperature (Tco) underwent an insignificant transient rise during the first \nhour of immersion, then declined steadily for several hours, although no \nsubject's Tco reached 35 degrees C. Despite the continued decrease in Tco, \nshivering had reached a steady state of approximately 2 x resting metabolism. \nHeat debt peaked at 932 +\/- 334 kJ after 2 h of immersion, indicating the \nattainment of heat balance, but unexpectedly proceeded to decline at \napproximately 48 kJ\/h, indicating a recovery of mean body temperature. These \nobservations were rationalized by introducing a third compartment of the body, \ncomprising fat, connective tissue, muscle, and bone, between the core (viscera \nand vessels) and skin. Temperature change in this \"mid region\" can account for \nthe incongruity between the body's heat debt and the changes in only the core \nand skin temperatures. The mid region temperature decreased by 3.7 +\/- 1.1 \ndegrees C at maximal heat debt and increased slowly thereafter. The reversal in \nheat debt might help explain why shivering drive failed to respond to a \ncontinued decrease in Tco, as shivering drive might be modulated by changes in \nbody heat content.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/japplphysiol.01195.2002\nPMID: 12639852 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Twenty-eight male \nsubjects [mean (SD) 23.8 (1.8) years] were randomly assigned to the control \n(COTG, n=10), cold-water immersion (CWIG, n=9), and double-cold-water immersion \ngroups (DCWIG, n=9). The cold-water immersion (15 min) was administered to the \nsubjects' legs after calf-raise exercise (CWIG: after recording initial \npost-exercise measures, DCWIG: after recording initial and 24 h post-exercise \nmeasures). Magnetic resonance T2-weighted images were obtained to calculate the \nT2 relaxation time (T2) of the triceps surae muscle before, immediately after, \nand at the following times post-exercise: 20, 40, and 60 min, and 24, 48, 96 and \n168 h. In addition, the ankle joint range of motion, serum creatine kinase and \nlactate dehydrogenase, and muscle soreness level were investigated before and \nafter exercise. In all groups, significant T2 elevations in the gastrocnemius \nmuscle appeared from immediately after to 60 min after exercise (P<0.05). \nThereafter, COTG showed significantly re-elevated T2 levels in the gastrocnemius \nat 96-168 h post-exercise (P<0.05), while CWIG and DCWIG showed significantly \nsmaller T2 values than the COTG at 96 h post-exercise (P<0.05). In addition, \nCOTG showed larger increases in serum enzymes at 96 h post-exercise (not \nsignificant) and significantly greater muscle soreness levels at 48 h \npost-exercise (P<0.05) than the cooling groups. The results of this study may \nsuggest that cooling has no dramatic effect, but some minor effects on reducing \nexercise-induced muscle edema in the subacute phase and relieving the extent of \nthe damaged muscle cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00421-002-0749-3\nPMID: 12627305 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Peter.Tikuisis@drdc-rddc.gc.ca\n\nBACKGROUND: Marksmanship has been reported to deteriorate during exposure to \nheat or cold, yet the effect of the resultant thermal strain in isolation of the \ninflicting thermal stress is not entirely clear. In most studies, the \ndebilitating effects on marksmanship are confounded by an evolving thermal \nstrain (in terms of body heat storage\/debt).\nHYPOTHESIS: Thermal strain (hot and cold) should degrade marksmanship, more with \nmoving targets than with conventional pop-up targets that are deemed less \nchallenging.\nMETHODS: The 12 rifle-trained military reservists (7 men and 5 women) were \ntested on their marksmanship skills using a small arms simulator. Subjects \nconducted three trials in an environmentally controlled chamber, 1 wk apart in a \ncounter-balanced order. Trial conditions were neutral (N; 22 degrees C), hot (H; \n35 degrees C), and cold (C; 5 degrees C), and all were preceded with an \nimmersion in water to chest level to establish thermal strain (for H and C) or \nto maintain thermal neutrality prior to shooting. Subjects fired a C7 rifle at \nvarious targets during sixteen 5-min engagements over 2 h. Targets were \npresented either as moving in an urban setting or as pop-ups in a lane setting. \nBody temperatures, heart rate, saliva cortisol concentration, subjective \nratings, and measures of marksmanship accuracy and precision were recorded and \nanalyzed using a repeated measures design.\nRESULTS: Mean +\/- SD of the rectal temperature during the shooting were 36.9 +\/- \n0.2 degrees C, 37.7 +\/- 0.3 degrees C, and 36.8 +\/- 0.6 degrees C for N, H, and \nC, respectively (H > N, C). Corresponding hand temperatures were 31.5 +\/- 1.2 \ndegrees C, 35.2 +\/- 0.7 degrees C, and 19.4 +\/- 3.0 degrees C (H > N > C). These \nbody temperatures were consistent with the subjective indices of heat illness, \ncold discomfort, and muscle discomfort. Cortisol concentration and perceived \nexertion were higher during H. Surprisingly, thermal strain did not degrade \nmarksmanship. Instead, some aspects of precision (horizontal displacement) and \naccuracy (shooting error) were poorer during N compared with H and C.\nCONCLUSIONS: Deep body temperatures not higher than approximately 37.9 degrees C \nand not less than 36.4 degrees C (accompanied by hand temperatures of not less \nthan 19 degrees C) do not negatively affect rifle marksmanship performance, even \nif significant respective sensations of heat and cold are present.\n\nPMID: 12498545 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In a supine \nposition, electrocardiogram and skin temperature of both index fingers were \nmeasured during immersion of right hand in cold water at 10 degrees C for 10 \nminutes.

Thus, crew and passengers must \nmake an underwater escape. It is postulated that later passengers in the escape \nsequence do not have the breath-holding ability to conduct a successful escape, \nparticularly if the water is cold. This contributes to the 20-50% mortality rate \nin survivable accidents.\nMETHODS: There were 132 immersed subject evaluations which were conducted in \ndaylight and darkness to measure escape times from a helicopter underwater \nescape trainer, configured to the Super Puma, seated for 15 and 18 passengers. \nThe subjects were highly experienced instructors or Navy clearance divers.\nRESULTS: The time from when each subject's head disappeared underwater until \neach subject surfaced and total fuselage evacuation time were measured and any \nproblems hampering escape were noted. Breath-holding for the last subject out \nranged from 28 to 92 s. An emergency breathing system was used by a minimum of \nfour subjects each time and a maximum of 11 subjects in one condition. The \nbuoyancy of the survival suit was the principal component that hampered escape.\nCONCLUSION: Breath-holding times were too long for the later subjects to escape \nwithout resorting to an EBS, in spite of the fact that they were highly trained. \nFor regular crew and passengers flying over water, this would explain the high \nmortality, etc. Therefore, a new helicopter standard should be developed \nrequiring fuselage design to accommodate total evacuation within 20 s from \nunderwater. For current helicopters, where this cannot be achieved, passengers \nshould be provided with some form of air supply, or, after ditching, the \nhelicopter should be modified so that it will stay afloat on its side and retain \nan air space in the cabin.\n\nPMID: 11396561 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We examined \nPTP in the ankle dorsiflexor muscles of 10 young men by evoking twitches before \nand after a 7-second tetanus at 100 Hz in a control (room air approximately 21 \ndegrees C) condition and after immersion of the lower leg in warm (45 degrees C) \nand cold (10 degrees C) water baths for 30 min. Exposure to cold decreased \ntetanus and pre-tetanus twitch peak torque, but increased rise time, \nhalf-relaxation time, and muscle action potential (M-wave) amplitude; exposure \nto warm water had little effect. PTP was smallest in cold exposure 5 s \npost-tetanus, but persisted throughout the 12 min test period, whereas PTP had \nsubsided by 6 min post-tetanus in control and warm exposures. M-wave amplitude \ninitially decreased after exposure to warm water, recovered, then decreased \nagain by 11 min post-tetanus. In contrast, exposure to cold had no initial \neffect but did increase the M-wave amplitude during the last half of the 12 min \ntest period, similar to that seen in the control. The greatest immediate \ndecrease in rise time and half-relaxation time was observed in the control; \nhowever, by 12 min post-tetanus warm exposure showed the greatest increase in \nrise time and half-relaxation time above pre-tetanus values.

The possibility of reduced oxygen \nutilization (VO2) by the muscles could not, however, be excluded. Accordingly, \nthe present study tested the hypothesis that mild narcosis, induced by \ninhalation of a normoxic gas mixture containing 30% nitrous oxide (N2O), would \naffect VO2. Nine male subjects participated in both maximal and submaximal \nexercise trials, inspiring either room air (AIR) or a normoxic mixture \ncontaining 30% N2O. In the submaximal trials, the subjects exercised at 50% of \nmaximal exercise intensity (Wmax) as determined in the maximal AIR trial. Though \nthe subjects attained the same Wmax in the AIR and N2O trials, maximal VO2 was \nsignificantly higher (P < 0.05) during the N2O condition [58.9 (SEM 3.1) ml x \nkg(-1) x min(-1)] compared to the AIR condition [55.0 (SEM 2.4) ml x kg(-1) x \nmin(-1)]. However, the VO2-relative exercise intensity relationship was similar \nduring both maximal AIR and maximal N2O at submaximal exercise intensities. \nThere were no significant differences in the responses of oesophageal \ntemperature, sweating rate, heart rate and ventilation between AIR and N2O in \nthe maximal and submaximal tests. It was concluded that the previously reported \nnarcosis-induced reductions in VO2 observed during cold water immersion can be \nattributed solely to a reduction in the shivering response rather than to \ndecreased oxygen utilization by the muscles.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s004210000203\nPMID: 10958377 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

One eye per subject \nwas investigated. Two images were obtained for each phase (baseline, cold phase \nand warm phase), and the better quality image from each phase was selected for \nthe measurements. One location on the temporal neuroretinal rim and one location \non the temporal retina outside the peripapillary area were selected for the HRF \nmeasurements.\nRESULTS: In the CG group neuroretinal rim \"Volume\" decreased by 26.05%, \"Flow\" \nby 25.82% and \"Velocity\" by 23.91% (p<0.05), retinal \"Volume\" decreased by \n12.30% (p=0.051), and retinal \"Flow\" by 22.36% (p=0.01) in the cold phase. All \nthese parameters returned to the corresponding baseline values in the warm \nphase. In the control group a significant decrease was observed in retinal \n\"Volume\" (15.96%), \"Flow\" (17.81%), and \"Velocity\" (16.11%) in the cold phase \n(p<0.05), which diminished in the warm phase but remained still significant for \n\"Flow\" and \"Velocity\".\nCONCLUSION: Cutaneous cold provocation can induce an immediate decrease in \nretinal and optic nerve head capillary perfusion at least in a part of the \nvasospastic subjects with or without capsular glaucoma. This decrease diminishes \nor disappears quickly when the hand is immersed in warm water. To evaluate the \npotential role of cold-induced retinal and optic nerve head vasoconstriction in \nthe pathogenesis of capsular glaucoma further investigations are necessary since \nthis reaction was also present in the vasospastic control subjects.\n\nPMID: 10943655 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

We used positron emission tomography (PET) to \nstudy the mechanisms mediating this specific effect in healthy, right-handed \nhuman males (ages 18-28 yr). Subjects received either painful cold (n = 11) or \npainless vibratory (n = 9) stimulation before and after the intravenous \ninjection of fentanyl (1.5 microgram\/kg) or placebo (saline). Compared with cool \nwater (29 degrees C), immersion of the hand in ice water (1 degrees C) is \npainful and produces highly significant increases in regional cerebral blood \nflow (rCBF) within the contralateral second somatosensory (S2) and insular \ncortex, bilaterally in the thalamus and cerebellum, and medially in the \ncerebellar vermis. Responses just below the statistical threshold (3.5 < Z < \n4.0) are seen in the contralateral anterior cingulate, ipsilateral insular \ncortex, and dorsal medial midbrain. The contralateral primary sensory cortex \n(S1) shows a trend of activation. Except for slight changes in intensity, this \npattern is unchanged following a saline placebo injection. Fentanyl reduces the \naverage visual analogue scale ratings of perceived pain intensity (47%) and \nunpleasantness (50%), reduces pain-related cardioacceleration, and has positive \nhedonic effects. After fentanyl, but not placebo, all cortical and subcortical \nresponses to noxious cold are greatly reduced. Subtraction analysis [(innocuous \nwater + fentanyl) - (innocuous water + no injection)] shows that fentanyl alone \nincreases rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex, particularly in the perigenual \nregion. Vibration (compared with mock vibration) evokes highly significant rCBF \nresponses in the contralateral S1 cortex in the baseline (no injection) and \nplacebo conditions; borderline responses (3.5 < Z < 4. 0) are detected also in \nthe contralateral thalamus. Fentanyl has no effect on the perceived intensity or \nunpleasantness of vibratory stimulation, which continues to activate \ncontralateral S1. Fentanyl alone [(mock vibration + fentanyl) - (mock vibration \n+ no injection)] again produces highly significant activation of the perigenual \nand mid-anterior cingulate cortex. A specific comparison of volumes of interest, \ndeveloped from activation peaks in the baseline condition (no injection), shows \nthat fentanyl strongly attenuates both the contralateral thalamic and S1 \ncortical responses to noxious cold stimulation (P < 0.048 and 0.007, \nrespectively) but fails to affect significantly these responses to vibrotactile \nstimulation (P > 0.26 and 0.91, respectively). In addition, fentanyl, compared \nwith placebo, produces a unique activation of the mid-anterior cingulate cortex \nduring fentanyl analgesia, suggesting that this region of the cingulate cortex \nparticipates actively in mediating opioid analgesia. The results are consistent \nwith a selective, fentanyl-mediated suppression of nociceptive spinothalamic \ntransmission to the forebrain. This effect could be implemented directly at the \nspinal level, indirectly through cingulate corticofugal pathways, or by a \ncombination of both mechanisms.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/jn.2000.84.1.525\nPMID: 10899224 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

It was found that the \nthermoregulatory functions of winter swimmers differ from those of \nnon-cold-adapted subjects. As evident from the relationship between rectal \ntemperature and the magnitude of cold thermogenesis, in controls a significant \npart of cold thermogenesis during the early phase of cooling was induced by \nchanges in peripheral temperature input, while in the late phase of cooling it \nwas the central temperature input which was mainly engaged in induction of cold \nthermogenesis. In winter swimmers the magnitude of cold thermogenesis was solely \nrelated to changes in rectal temperature, indicating the predominance of the \ncentral temperature input in activation of heat production mechanisms. The \nthermoregulatory threshold for induction of cold thermogenesis was lowered (by \n0.34 C), but the apparent hypothalamic thermosensitivity was the same as in \nnon-cold-adapted subjects. These differences are indicative of adaptation of \nthermoregulatory control centres. Additionally, the activity of thermoregulatory \neffectors was also changed. Shivering was induced later during cooling (after 40 \nmin) in winter swimmers than in controls, which suggests an important \nparticipation of non-shivering thermogenesis in the early thermogenic response. \nWinter swimmers also showed bradycardia and a greater reduction in plasma volume \nduring cooling. The data indirectly indicate restriction of heat loss from the \nbody. Only a non-significant increase in quantity of subcutaneous fat was \nobserved in winter swimmers. Thus, winter swimmers were able to survive a \nsignificantly greater temperature gradient between body and environment than \nnon-cold-adapted subjects by modifying the sensory functions of hypothalamic \nthermoregulatory centres to lower heat loss and produce less heat during cold \nexposure. Additionally, the capacity of the total cold thermogenesis due to \npotentiation of non-shivering heat production was also increased. Heat produced \ndue to thermogenic action of adrenaline may represent more than a quarter of the \ntotal cold thermogenesis. In conclusion, the data suggest that winter swimmers \nexhibit metabolic, hypothermic and insulative types of cold adaptation.\n\nPMID: 10825419 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Net \ntransfemoral balance of AII and of ET-1 was calculated from the respective \nArterio-Venous (A-V) differences in plasma concentrations (PC) of the peptides \nand the regional plasma flow (indocyanine-green dye method), both at baseline \nconditions and after a cold stimulus (immersion of one hand into ice water) in \n7H and 6N, or during short-time hyperinsulinemia (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic \nclamp: biosynthetic human insulin, 1 mU\/kg\/min) in 7H and 7N. Moreover, \nhemodynamic changes to sequential exogenous ET-1 infusion (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 \nng\/min) or during hyperinsulinemic clamp were studied in 7H and 6N and 7H and \n7N, respectively. Baseline net-transfemoral balance of ET-1 and of AII were \nsimilar in the two subject groups. The cold stimulus provoked a similar increase \nin transfemoral ET-1 release in H and N (H: 257.0+\/-31.7 to 526.2+\/-393.7 \npg\/min; N: 280.2+\/-112.7 to 524.0+\/-393.7 pg\/min, mean +\/- SD, P<.05). In \ncontrast, the cold-induced increase in transfemoral AII release was somewhat \nmore pronounced in H than in N (H: 162.2+\/-304.6 to 1081.7+\/-1037.7 pg\/ min, \nP<.05; N: 83.9+\/-166.3 to 317.6+\/-187.8 pg\/ min, P<.02; maximum value H v. N \nP<.05). During the hyperinsulinemic clamp the PC of insulin increased from \n5.8+\/-2.8 to 69.1+\/-15.5 microU\/ mL in H and from 4.6+\/-1.7 to 67.5+\/-9,5 \nmicroU\/mL in N; P<.0005. Hyperinsulinemia induced a similar elevation of \nnorepinephrine PC in H and N, but an increase in transfemoral ET-1 release in N \nonly (219.7+\/-161.2 to 512.2+\/-279.0 pg\/min, P<.02). In contrast, \nhyperinsulinemia increased transfemoral AII formation in H (730.4+\/-554.3 to \n1088.6+\/-597.9 pg\/min, P<.05), but not in N. Insulin-mediated vasodilation was \nobserved only in N, whereas ET-1-induced vasoconstriction was blunted in H. We \nconclude that the cold-induced increase in peripheral vascular release of AII is \nmore pronounced in H than in N, whereas insulin provokes an increase in AII \nformation in hypertensives only. Moreover, insulin-mediated vasodilation and \nET-1-dependent vasoconstriction are blunted in hypertensive subjects.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/s0895-7061(99)00137-5\nPMID: 10604480 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Tests were separated by a minimum of two \ndays. The protocol consisted of a 10 minute warm up at 60% of VO2peak followed \nby three minutes of stretching. This was immediately followed by the 70 second \npower test which was performed on a standard road bicycle equipped with 172.5 mm \npowermeter cranks and mounted on a stationary ergometer.\nRESULTS: Mean power output for the 70 second performance test after precooling \nwas significantly (p<0.005) increased by 3.3 (2.7)% from 581 (57) W to 603 (60) \nW. Precooling also significantly (p<0.05) decreased core, mean body, and upper \nand lower body skin temperature; however, by the start of the performance test, \nlower body skin temperature was no different from control. After precooling, \nheart rate was also significantly lower than control throughout the warm up \n(p<0.05). Ratings of perceived exertion were significantly higher than the \ncontrol condition at the start of the warm up after precooling, but lower than \nthe control condition by the end of the warm up (p<0.05). No differences in \nblood lactate concentration were detected between conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Precooling improves short term cycling performance, possibly by \ninitiating skin vasoconstriction which may increase blood availability to the \nworking muscles.

On four separate occasions, seven healthy men [mean \nage 24.0 +\/- 1.9 (SE) yr, peak oxygen consumption = 45.7 +\/- 2.0 ml. kg(-1). \nmin(-1)] sat for 2 h in a climatic chamber maintained at 5 degrees C.

In another pretreatment, subjects were passively heated in \na warm (38 degrees C) water bath for 1 h. In two other pretreatments, subjects \nexercised for 1 h at 55% peak oxygen consumption (once immersed in 18 degrees C \nwater and once in 35 degrees C water). Core temperature rose by 1 degrees C \nduring passive heating and during exercise in 35 degrees C water and remained \nstable during exercise in 18 degrees C water (thermal clamping). Subsequent cold \nexposure induced a leukocytosis and granulocytosis, an increase in natural \nkiller cell count and activity, and a rise in circulating levels of \ninterleukin-6. Pretreatment with exercise in 18 degrees C water augmented the \nleukocyte, granulocyte, and monocyte response. These results indicate that acute \ncold exposure has immunostimulating effects and that, with thermal clamping, \npretreatment with physical exercise can enhance this response. Increases in \nlevels of circulating norepinephrine may account for the changes observed during \ncold exposure and their modification by changes in initial status.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/jappl.1999.87.2.699\nPMID: 10444630 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

After performing a bout of damage-inducing eccentric exercise (eight \nsets of five maximal reciprocal contractions at 0.58 rad x s(-1)) of the elbow \nflexors on an isokinetic dynamometer, 15 females aged 22.0+\/-2.0 years (mean +\/- \ns) were allocated to a control group (no treatment, n = 7) or a cryotherapy \ngroup (n = 8). Subjects in the cryotherapy group immersed their exercised arm in \ncold water (15 degrees C) for 15 min immediately after eccentric exercise and \nthen every 12 h for 15 min for a total of seven sessions. Muscle tenderness, \nplasma creatine kinase activity, relaxed elbow angle, isometric strength and \nswelling (upper arm circumference) were measured immediately before and for 3 \ndays after eccentric exercise. Analysis of variance revealed significant (P < \n0.05) main effects for time for all variables, with increases in muscle \ntenderness, creatine kinase activity and upper arm circumference, and decreases \nin isometric strength and relaxed elbow angle. There were significant \ninteractions (P<0.05) of group x time for relaxed elbow angle and creatine \nkinase activity. Relaxed elbow angle was greater and creatine kinase activity \nlower for the cryotherapy group than the controls on days 2 and 3 following the \neccentric exercise.

Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to exert an \nanti-hypertensive effect, and this may alter the blood pressure hyperreactivity \nobserved in African Americans. To test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise \nattenuates pressor reactivity in African Americans, we studied eight healthy \naerobically-trained normotensive African-American females and five similar \nsedentary females. The stress stimuli consisted of the cold pressor test with \nthe foot immersed in ice water for two minutes. The aerobic exercise training \nprotocol consisted of six weeks of jogging at 60-70% of peak oxygen uptake \n(VO2peak), three days\/week for 35 min\/exercise session.

The precooling trial (PC) \ninvolved lowering body core temperature (-0.5 degrees C rectal temperature, Tre) \nin water before swimming. The control trial (CON) was identical except no \nprecooling was performed. Water temperature and environmental conditions were \nmaintained at 25.6 degrees C and 26.6 degrees C\/60% rh, respectively, throughout \nall testing.\nRESULTS: Mean time to precool was 31+\/-8 min and average time to reach baseline \nTre during cycling was 9+\/-7 min. Oxygen uptake (VO2), HR, skin temperature \n(Tsk), Tre, RPE, and thermal sensation (TS) were recorded following the swim \nsegment and throughout cycling. No significant differences in mean body (Tb) or \nTsk were noted between PC and CON, but a significant difference (P < 0.05) in \nTre between treatments was noted through the early phases of cycling. No \nsignificant differences were reported in HR, VO2, RPE, TS, or sweat rate (SR) \nbetween treatments. Body heat storage (S) was negative following swimming in \nboth PC (-92+\/-6 W x m2) and CON (-66+\/-9 W x m2). A greater S occurred in PC \n(109+\/-6 W x m2) vs CON (79+\/-4 W x m2) during cycling (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Precooling attenuated the rise in Tre, but this effect was \ntransient.

Treatment \nconsisted of complete body immersion in cold or warm water baths. Fifteen \nvolunteers were investigated by means of transcranial Doppler sonography and a \nservo-controlled noninvasive device for blood pressure measuring. One group of 8 \nvolunteers (mean age, 27.2+\/-3.5 yr; gender, 3 females\/5 males) was subjected to \ncold baths of 22 degrees C for 20 min Another group of 7 volunteers (mean age, \n52.1+\/-8.5 yr; gender, 4 females\/3 males) took hyperthermic baths at rising \nwater temperatures from 36 degrees to 42 degrees C, increased by 1 degree C \nevery 5 min. Each volunteer in both groups underwent autoregulation tests two to \nfour times before, during, and after the thermic bath. Dynamic autoregulation \nwas measured by the response of cerebral blood flow velocity to a transient \ndecrease of the mean arterial blood pressure, induced by rapid deflation of \nthigh cuffs. The autoregulation index, i.e., a measure of the speed of change of \ncerebral autoregulation, was used to quantify the response. Further parameters \nwere core temperature, blood pressure (mm Hg) and CO2et. During hypothermic \nbaths, core temperature decreased by 0.3 degrees C (P = 0.001), measured between \npreliminary phase and the end of the bath; the autoregulation index decreased \nsignificantly (P < 0.05) from 5.3 before the bath to 4.25 during the bath. \nDuring hyperthermic baths, the autoregulation index increased from 6.0 to 7.5 \nand 8.9 (P < 0.001), with an increase of core temperature of 0.4 degrees C. The \nmain cerebral autoregulation system is dependent on changes of core temperature, \nprovoked by hypothermic or hyperthermic whole-body thermostimulus. Application \nof hyperthermic baths increased the autoregulation index, and hypothermic baths \ndecreased the autoregulation index. Further studies are needed to prove the \npositive effects of thermo-stimulating water applications on cerebral \nhemodynamics in patients with cerebral diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/00002060-199901000-00009\nPMID: 9923427 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

One volunteer experienced transient (30 min) \nlumbar pain after injection at a dose of 2,000 microg. There were no other \ncomplications in any other volunteers. Adenosine reduced, in a \nnon-dose-dependent manner, the areas of secondary allodynia after skin \ninflammation (brush, P < 0.06; and von Frey hair, P < 0.03) and reduced the \nforearm tourniquet ischemic pain rating (P = 0.01). Tactile pain thresholds were \nsignificantly reduced by mustard oil inflammation during control, whereas \nadenosine treatment prevented this reduction. The ice water-induced cold pain \nrating was not influenced by adenosine.\nCONCLUSIONS: An intrathecal adenosine injection of 1,000 microg lacked side \neffects in healthy volunteers.

The present \ninvestigation examined the thermal and metabolic responses in males who were fed \ncapsaicin (CAP: 2 mg.kg(-1) body weight) vs. a placebo (PL: a maltodextrin \ncapsule) prior to immersion in cold water.\nMETHODS: Seven Caucasian males aged 20-28 yr were immersed in 22 degrees C twice \n(PL vs. CAP), for 120 min. The following were examined: metabolism (M; W.m(-2)), \nrectal temperature (Tre; degrees C), mean skin temperature (Tsk; degrees C), \ntissue insulation (I; degrees C.m(-2).W(-1) and proportion of energy derived \nfrom carbohydrate (%CHO).\nRESULTS: For M, Tre, I, and Tsk there was no significant differences between \ntreatments (PL vs. CAP) when the variables were pooled jointly over time. \nHowever, significant differences across time was detected for Tre (p = 0.0003), \nTsk (p = 0.0147), and M (p = 0.0036). Values for %CHO demonstrate a main effect \nfor treatment (p = 0.0210) suggesting the CAP (46.7-\/+25.9%) treatment \ndemonstrated a decreased reliance on carbohydrate utilization for energy \nprovision as compared to the PL (75.0+\/-21.9%) treatment. Additionally, the \ntreatment x time interaction was significant (p = 0.0096) whereby, PL differed \nfrom CAP at 5 min only.\nCONCLUSION: From these data it appears that while M, Tre, and Tsk differed \nacross time, a CAP (which differentially affected percent of energy derived from \ncarbohydrate) feeding did not differentially affect the thermal and metabolic \nresponses of males during acute cold water immersion.\n\nPMID: 9819168 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In the present study, two experiments were conducted: one \nwith a recall memory test and one with a recognition memory test. One hundred \nsixty undergraduate subjects were randomly placed in one of four groups: two \ngroups had the same condition (pain or no pain) for both the encoding task and \nmemory test, and two groups had mixed conditions (pain at encoding-no pain at \nmemory test or no pain at encoding-pain at memory test). Pain was induced by 0 \ndegrees-2 degrees C water immersion. At encoding, subjects categorized words by \njudging them as either positive or negative. Results of both experiments show \nthat pain impairs memory. In neither experiment were differences found on memory \nfor positive and negative words. These results do not support Seltzer and \nYarczower's discriminative effects of pain on word category, but they are \nconsistent with other research using acute pain manipulations and chronic pain \npopulations, suggesting that pain interferes with memory.

In homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease, skin cooling is a common \nprecipitating factor of the painful crisis which is associated with avascular \nnecrosis of active bone marrow. Since skin cooling does not directly induce \nsickling, we have investigated the nature of the reflex vascular responses to \nmild cooling in SS patients in a steady state of the disease and compared them \nwith their history of painful crises. 2. Experiments were performed in Jamaica \non 60 male SS patients and 30 matched control subjects with normal haemoglobin \n(AA) genotype. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured by venous occlusion \nplethysmography and mean arterial pressure (MAP) by a Finapres device: forearm \nvascular resistance (FVR) was calculated as MAP\/FBF. Cutaneous erythrocyte flux \nin forearm and hand was monitored by a laser Doppler meter. The contralateral \nhand was immersed in cool water at 16 degrees C for 2 min, 6 times, at random \nintervals of 0.5-3 min. 3. The first cool immersion evoked an increase in MAP, \ncutaneous vasoconstriction and a net increase in FVR in both AA and SS subjects. \nHowever, the direction of change in FVR varied between individuals such that 18 \nAA subjects showed an increase in FVR (constrictor group) while 12 showed a \ndecrease in FVR, indicating vasodilatation in forearm muscle (dilator group). In \ncontrast, 50 SS subjects showed an increase in FVR and only 10 showed a decrease \nin FVR. The proportion of subjects who showed net vasoconstriction was \nsignificantly greater in the SS than in the AA group (83% versus 60%, P = 0.03, \nchi 2 test). 4. By the sixth cool stimulus, the 'dilator' group of AA subjects \nshowed no change in FVR while the 'dilator' group of SS patients showed an \nincrease in FVR. We suggest that forearm muscle vasodilatation was the \ncharacteristic component of the alerting\/defence response to novel or noxious \nstimuli which habituates on repetition. 5. In the whole group of SS patients, \nbaseline values of cutaneous vascular resistance and FVR increased between \nstimuli, indicating persistent vasoconstriction, and the sixth cool stimulus \nstill evoked cutaneous vasoconstriction and a net increase in FVR. In contrast, \nAA subjects showed an increase in baseline FVR between stimuli, but the sixth \ncool stimulus had no significant effect on cutaneous vascular resistances, or \nFVR. 6. In SS patients there were no associations between the direction of \nchange in FVR evoked by the first cool stimulus and forearm circumference or \nskinfold thickness, concentrations of haemoglobin or fetal haemoglobin. However, \nthe frequency of painful crises was significantly greater in the 'constrictor' \ngroup than in the 'dilator' group (0.36 versus 0.12\/year, P = 0.04, Mann-Whitney \ntest). 7. These results indicate that the primary reflex vasoconstrictor \nresponse evoked by mild cooling is stronger and more persistent in SS patients \nthan in AA subjects and is particularly strong in SS patients who are most prone \nto painful crises. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that skin \ncooling may precipitate the painful crisis by causing reflex vasoconstriction in \nmuscle, and possibly in bone marrow, so diverting blood flow away from the \nactive marrow.\n\nDOI: 10.1042\/cs0940111\nPMID: 9536918 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The present study was designed \nto compare extrathoracic and tracheobronchial contributions to thermal washout \ncurves. Respiratory frequency, air ambient temperature, and body core \ntemperature (tc) were varied in six male subjects before and after immersion in \ncold (1.1 degrees C) water for up to 2 h under three conditions: 1) control: \nambient temperature (tamb) = 25 degrees C, rectal temperature change (delta tre) \n= 0 degrees C; 2) pre-immersion: tamb = 4 degrees C, delta tre = 0 degrees C; \nand 3) post-immersion: tamb = 25 degrees C, delta tre = -0.7 degrees C. Both \npeak expiratory nasal (tpn) and oral (tpo) airstream temperatures were measured. \nEach subject was tested twice. Expiratory tpo was generally higher than tpn in \nall conditions. Increasing breathing rates lowered tpn and tpo in the control \nand cold air environments. Orifice temperatures, which are presumed to reflect \nupper airway blood temperatures, correlated with both tpn and tpo. Lowering tc \nhad no effect on washout curves during quiet breathing and affected only tpn \nduring rapid breathing. The results suggest that while tracheobronchial \nconditions may contribute to thermal washout curves, extrathoracic conditions \npredominate. Strong correlations between orifice temperatures, peak expiratory \nnasal temperatures and peak expiratory oral temperature demonstrate the dominant \nrole of upper airway heat exchange in determining thermal washout curves.\n\nDOI: 10.1183\/09031936.97.10122778\nPMID: 9493660 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Fourteen healthy \nvolunteers were studied while in the supine position with electrocardiography, \nblood pressure monitoring and electro-oculography. The muscle sympathetic nerve \nactivity (MSNA) was recorded directly from the bilateral tibial nerves by using \nmicroneurographic double recording technique. Caloric vestibular stimulation was \nloaded by alternate irrigation with 50 ml of cold (10 degrees C) water and 50 ml \nof hot (44 degrees C) water into the left and right external meatus. After cold \nwater irrigation, two MSNA response peaks were elicited, respectively, before \nand after the maximum slow phase velocity (SPV) of nystagmus. The first peak of \nthe MSNA enhancement was caused by non-specific factors because its time course \ncoincided with that in cold pressor test with immersion of the subject's hand in \nice\/water (4 degrees C). Transient suppression of MSNA after cold water \nirrigation in the period of maximum SPV of nystagmus was observed by cross \ncorrelogram analysis between the SPV of the nystagmus and MSNA. After hot water \nirrigation, only one MSNA response peak was elicited after the period of strong \nnystagmus. The second peak of MSNA enhancement evoked by cold irrigation (379.4 \n+\/- 221.8%, with the control value set as 100%, mean +\/- SE) was significantly \nhigher than that evoked by hot irrigation (243.0 +\/- 14.5%). The degree of MSNA \nenhancement by either cold (the second peak) or hot stimulation was proportional \nto the maximum SPV of the nystagmus. There was no significant difference between \nthe MSNA responses ipsilateral to and contralateral to the irrigated side. In \nconclusion, the caloric vestibular stimulation can influence the bilateral \nsympathetic outflow to muscle in humans. The degree of MSNA enhancement is \nproportional to the magnitude of vestibular excitement indicated by maximum slow \nphase velocity of the nystagmus.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/s0165-1838(97)00077-5\nPMID: 9406120 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In the \npresent investigation two EUBA were examined: the Air Pocket (AP) rebreather and \nthe Short Term Air Supply System (STASS) mini SCUBA set.\nMETHOD: Young, healthy male subjects undertook simple simulated helicopter \nunderwater escapes in water at 15 degrees C and\/or 5 degrees C. During the \nimmersions the subjects attempted to remain submerged for 60 s while traversing \nback and forth along a ladder secured at a depth of 1.25 m. At each temperature \nthe subjects used AP and STASS twice. The subjects were dressed in the Royal \nNavy winter sea helicopter aircrew equipment assembly and an aircrew helmet.\nRESULTS: Both AP and STASS significantly extended the underwater survival time \nof individuals when compared to their maximum breath-hold time (BHT). It is \nclear from the measurements made of gas concentrations in AP; the volume of air \nused from STASS; and subjective responses, that the 60-s submersions were \nachieved more easily with STASS than AP.\nCONCLUSION: It is concluded that in conditions similar to those of the present \nexperiment STASS will give a longer underwater duration than AP, but this \nbenefit must be offset against the possible risk of pulmonary barotrauma \nassociated with the use of STASS, as well as increased training and maintenance \ncosts.

In a prospective, double-blind, randomized, \nplacebo-controlled trial, we studied the effects of thiopental at presumed \nsteady-state, \"conscious sedation\" levels on cold-pressor-induced pain in 12 \nhealthy volunteers.\nMETHODS: Five drug conditions were used, each condition consisting of an \ninjection (either drug or placebo) with a 20-min infusion and a 160-min recovery \nperiod. The conditions were placebo (saline), thiopental targeted to three \neffect-site concentrations, and fentanyl (1.4 micrograms\/kg), as a positive \ncontrol to verify test sensitivity to analgesic drugs. The three thiopental \nconcentrations were modeled (STANPUMP) to achieve effect-site concentrations of \n5, 7.5, and 10 micrograms\/ml using a bolus and a three-step continuous infusion. \nFive minutes into the infusion period and 115 min after the infusion period was \nterminated, subjects immersed their forearms in ice cold water for 3 min while \npain and behavioral assessments were recorded.\nRESULTS: Thiopental at the highest dose produced a significant reduction (P < \n0.05) in self-reported pain intensity both at 5 min into the infusion period and \nat 115 min after termination of the infusion.

Resting and stress \nblood pressure were measured during blood sampling, cold water foot immersion, \nand a video game before and after 1 week each of supplementation with potassium \ncitrate, 1.5 mmol\/kg per day, and placebo administered in random order.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine children aged 7 to 15 years were studied. White subjects \nhad higher baseline excretion of potassium than black subjects (p < 0.001) and \nhigher vegetable intake (p < 0.01), which were positively correlated (r = 0.53, \np < 0.001). At baseline, the 24-hour urinary potassium\/creatinine ratio varied \ninversely with diastolic CVR to the video game stressor in white children (r = \n-0.55, p = 0.02). Cardiovascular reactivity was not attenuated measurably by \npotassium supplementation compared with placebo. The CVR was greater in children \nwith a family history of hypertension than in those without, but was not greater \nin black children than in white children.\nCONCLUSIONS: The urinary potassium\/creatinine ratio is higher in white than \nblack children because their intake of vegetables is greater; dietary potassium \nintake may modulate CVR, particularly in white children with a family history of \nhypertension, but may need to be supplemented for more than 1 week to \ndemonstrate attenuation of CVR; and a family history of hypertension may be a \nstronger predictor of enhanced CVR than is race.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/s0022-3476(97)70129-x\nPMID: 9255197 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

This data analysis revisited this hypothesis and \ncompared previously published data with unpublished data from our laboratory on \nthose subjects that were terminated from cold water immersion early because of a \nreduction in rectal temperature (T(re)) - 35 degrees C. T(re), mean skin \ntemperature (T(sk)), and oxygen uptake (VO2) were recorded at 5, 30, 60, and 90 \nmin of immersion and were used to calculate 3delta readings for each exposure, \nthat is, deltaT(30) minus T5, T60 minus T(30), and T(90) minus T(60). Single \ngroup t-tests were used to examine differences in deltaT(re), deltaT(sk), and \ndeltaVO2 between the published data (PD) group and the individual subjects who \nwere terminated early (TE) at each of three water temperatures (18 degrees C, 22 \ndegrees C, 26 degrees C). For deltaVO2 the TE subjects were dichotomized by \nfatness (low percent fat, 8%-12%; or high percent fat, 18%-22%) to account for \nthe VO2 differences between these groups (i.e., fatness) during cold water \nimmersion. deltaT(re) was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in TE subjects \ncompared with PD subjects at all timepoints for 18 degrees C and 26 degrees C. \nAt 22 degrees C, the TE subject exhibited a significantly greater (p < 0.05) \ndecrease in deltaT(re) than the PD group at 90 min of immersion only. No \nsignificant (p > 0.05) differences in deltaT(sk) between the PD and TE groups \nwere detected for any of the exposure temperatures over all time points. No \ndifference (p > 0.05) between PD subjects and TE subjects for deltaVO2 was \nexhibited at any time point at any temperature. It appears that with respect to \nthe TE group, elevations in VO2 were comparable to the PD group, but the TE \ngroup was unable to maintain T(re) during cold water immersion. In conclusion, \nfrom these data it appears that shivering thermogenesis does in part enhance the \nindividual's ability to maintain T(re); however, as evidenced in the TE group, \nit also appears that the alterations in shivering thermogenesis for certain \nindividuals may not be great enough to offset heat loss.\n\nDOI: 10.1580\/1080-6032(1997)008[0003:dsteti]2.3.co;2\nPMID: 11990135 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In contrast \nto prazosin, tamsulosin has a higher affinity for prostatic than vascular alpha \n1-adrenoceptors in vitro. The functional correlate of this observation in humans \nis the subject of this study. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade by oral \ntamsulosin (0.2 mg), doxazosin (1 mg) or placebo on finger tip vascular and \ndorsal hand venous alpha 1-adrenoceptors stimulated by cold treatment (immersion \nin ice water) and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine, was thus \nstudied in a 3-way crossover study in eight, healthy, male adults. Finger tip \nvasoconstriction after cold stimulation was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry. \nA linear variable differential transformer was used to assess the drug effect on \nphenylephrine-induced venoconstriction. All study parameters were assessed at \naround 2 and 3.5 h after oral intake of doxazosin and tamsulosin respectively. \nThe drug plasma levels were not significantly different. No significant \ndifferences were found for blood pressure or heart rate in the three treatments \nin supine and erect position. The reduction in finger tip blood flow after cold \nstimulation was significantly smaller after doxazosin treatment (P < 0.01) than \nafter tamsulosin or placebo, whereas there was no significant difference between \ntamsulosin and placebo treatments. The infusion rate of phenylephrine producing \na half-maximum venoconstriction was significantly larger after doxazosin than \nafter tamsulosin (P < 0.05) or placebo (P < 0.01), whereas there was again no \nsignificant difference between tamsulosin and placebo treatments.

We wished to determine whether there are differences in the spatial pattern \nand intensity of synaptic activity within the conscious human forebrain when \ndifferent forms and intensities of innocuous and noxious thermal stimuli are \nexperienced. Accordingly, positron emission tomography (PET) with intravenous \ninjection of H2(15)O was used to detect increases in regional cerebral blood \nflow (rCBF) in normal humans as they discriminated differences in the intensity \nof noxious and innocuous thermal stimulation applied to the nondominant (left) \narm. After stereotactic registration, subtraction images were formed from each \nsubject by subtracting counts of emissions obtained during lower-intensity \nstimulation from those obtained during stimulation at higher intensities. A \nstatistical summation analysis (Z score) of individual voxels was performed. In \naddition, volumes of interest were chosen on the basis of a priori hypotheses \nand the results of previously published PET studies. In both types of analysis, \nstatistical thresholds were established with corrections for multiple \ncomparisons. 2. Twenty-seven subjects were divided into three groups of nine \nsubjects each for the three phases of this investigation. For studies in which \nrepetitive contact heat stimuli were used, each subject was instructed in \nmagnitude estimation on the basis of a scale for which 0 indicated \"no heat \nsensation,\" 7 \"just barely painful,\" and 10 \"just barely tolerable.\" For the \nstudy of pain elicited by immersion of the hand in cold water, subjects were \ninstructed to use a scale in which 0 represented \"no pain\" and 10 represented \njust barely tolerable pain. 3. In the warm-discrimination study, two intensities \nof innocuous heat (36 and 43 degrees C) were applied with a thermode as \nrepetitive 5-s contacts to the volar forearm for a total of approximately 100 s, \n8 stimuli before and 12 during each scan. Each temperature was applied on \nalternate scans for a total of four scans per subject. Neither stimulus was \nrated painful. All subjects discriminated the 43 degrees C stimulus (average \nrating 5.90 +\/- 1.43, mean +\/- SD) from the 36 degrees C stimulus (1.96 +\/- \n1.08, mean +\/- SD; t = 13.19, P < 0.0001). Significant increases in rCBF to the \n43 degrees C stimuli were found in the contralateral ventral posterior thalamus, \nlenticular nucleus, medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's areas 10 and 32), and \ncerebellar vermis. 4. The procedure for discriminating between noxious and \ninnocuous heat stimuli was identical to that used for warm discrimination except \nthat the stimulation temperatures were 40 and 50 degrees C. All subjects rated \nthe 50 degrees C stimuli as painful (average rating 8.9 +\/- 0.9, mean +\/- SD) \nand the 40 degrees C stimuli as warm, but not painful (2.1 +\/- 1.0). Significant \nrCBF increases to 50 degrees C stimuli were found contralaterally in the \nthalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, premotor cortex, and secondary \nsomatosensory (S2) and posterior insular cortices. Significant activity also \nappeared within the region of the contralateral anterior insula and lenticular \nnucleus. The ipsilateral premotor cortex and thalamus, and the medial dorsal \nmidbrain and cerebellar vermis, also showed significant rCBF increases. Cerebral \nblood flow (CBF) increases just below the threshold for statistical significance \nwere seen in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex [primary motor cortex \n(M1)\/primary somatosensory cortex (S1)]. 5. For discrimination between tonic \ninnocuous cold and tonic cold pain, the left hand was immersed to the wrist, \nthroughout each of six scans, in water kept at an average temperature of either \n20.5 +\/- 1.15 degrees C (mean +\/- SD) or 6.02 +\/- 1.18 degrees C (mean +\/- SD) \non alternate scans. All subjects rated the intensity of the stimuli on a scale \nin which 0 indicated no pain and 10 represented barely tolerable pain.

Repeated exposures of young \nsportsmen to cold water (head out, 14 degrees C, 1 h, 3 times per week for 4-6 \nweeks) induced changes in regulation of thermal homeostasis. \"Cold acclimated\" \nsubjects exhibited an hypothermic type of adaptation. Central and peripheral \nbody temperatures at rest and during cold immersion were lowered. The metabolic \nresponse to cold was delayed and subjective shivering was attenuated. The \nobserved hypothermia was due to the shift of the threshold for induction of cold \nthermogenesis to lower body temperatures. \"Cold acclimated\" subjects also showed \na lowered cold sensation. Because of the observed physiological changes, about \n20% of the total heat production was saved during one cold water immersion of \n\"cold acclimated\" subjects. Maximal aerobic and anaerobic performances were not \naltered. No change in the thermosensitivity of the body temperature controller, \nas assessed from the unchanged slope of the relation between the deep body \ntemperature and total heat production, was observed. Changes in cold sensation \nand regulation of cold thermogenesis were noticed first after four cold water \nimmersions and persisted for at least 2 weeks after termination of the \nadaptation procedure. A trend towards a small increase in the body fat content \nwas also observed. This finding, as well as the increased vasoconstriction, \nevidenced by the lowered skin temperature, indicate that slight changes in body \ninsulation may also occur after \"cold acclimation\" in humans.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s004240050146\nPMID: 8765994 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

In cold-exposed animals, 3-10% \ninspired CO2 impairs thermal homeostasis by attenuating shivering and promoting \nheat loss through peripheral vasodilation. Experimental results with humans are \nequivocal.\nPURPOSE: To determine the effects of hypercapnia on warm and cold \nthermoregulatory responses and core cooling rates during mild cold stress, we \nexamined the core temperature (TCO) thresholds for sweating, vasoconstriction \nand shivering, as well as core cooling rates of eight subjects immersed in 28 \ndegrees C water under hypercapnic conditions.\nMETHODS: On two separate days, subjects exercised on an underwater cycle \nergometer to elevate TCO above the sweating threshold. They then rested and \ncooled until they shivered vigorously. Subjects inspired humidified room air \nduring the control trial and 4% CO2\/20.9% O2\/balance N2 during the hypercapnia \ntrial.\nRESULTS: Hypercapnia lowered the threshold for shivering by 0.13 degrees C and \nincreased the core cooling rate by 0.35 degrees C.h-1 (25%). Minute ventilation \nwas approximately 12.0 L.min-1 throughout cooling during control and increased \nfrom 25.3 to 28.7 L.min-1 during hypercapnia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Therefore, hypercapnia enhances the core cooling rate during mild \ncold stress. This may be attributed in part to a delay in shivering onset, as \nwell as increased respiratory heat loss during hypercapnic hyperventilation.\n\nPMID: 8725470 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

The independent \ncontributions of local (peripheral) and\/or whole body (central) cooling are not \nknown. Therefore, a protocol was developed in which the arm and the rest of the \nbody could be independently cooled.\nMETHODS: Biceps temperature (Tmus), at a depth of 20 mm, and esophageal \ntemperature (Tes) were measured. Six subjects were immersed to the clavicles in \na tank (body tank) of water under 3 conditions: 1) cold body-cold arm (CB-CA); \n2) warm body-cold arm (WB-CA); and 3) cold body-warm arm (CB-WA). In the latter \ntwo conditions, subjects placed their dominant arm in a separate (arm) tank. \nWater temperature (Tw) in each tank was independently controlled. In conditions \nrequiring cold body and\/or cold arm, Tw in the appropriate tanks was 8 degrees \nC. In conditions requiring warm body and\/or warm arm, Tw in the appropriate \ntanks was adjusted between 29 and 38 degrees C to maintain body\/arm temperature \nat baseline values. A battery of 6 tests, requiring fine or gross motor \nmovements, were performed immediately before immersion and after 15, 45, and 70 \nminutes of immersion.\nRESULTS: In CB-CA, Tes decreased from an average of 37.2 to 35.6 degrees C and \nTmus decreased from 34.6 to 22.0 degrees C. In WB-CA, Tmus decreased to 18.1 \ndegrees C (Tes = 37.1 degrees C), and in CB-WA, Tes decreased to 35.8 degrees C \n(Tmus = 34.5 degrees C). By the end of immersion, there were significant \ndecrements (43-85%) in the performance of all tests in CB-CA and WB-CA (p < \n0.0002); scores for each test were similar in these two conditions. There was no \nsignificant change in scores throughout the CB-WA condition. In both conditions \nwith arm cooling (i.e., WB-CA and CB-CA), Tmus accounted for 85-98% of the \nvariance in all tests. When the core was cooled in the CB-WA condition, Tes was \nsignificantly correlated to scores in only two tests (accounted for 90 and 93% \nof the variance) although the actual effect was small. In the CB-CA condition, \npartial correlations indicated that Tes accounted for 4-10% of the variance in \nscores of 4 tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that cooling of the body and\/or the arm elicits large \ndecrements in finger, hand and arm performance. The decrements are due almost \nentirely to the local effects of arm tissue cooling.\n\nPMID: 8526834 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Body composition was determined via underwater \ndensitometry. Subjects were divided with respect to high body fat (HF; 18-22%, n \n= 12) or low body fat (LF; 8-12%, n = 12) and randomly assigned to one of three \nwater temperatures. Body heat debt and R did not differ between the LF or HF \ngroups, between temperatures, or across time. Percent calories utilized \nindicated that for these experimental conditions the predominant substrate \nutilized between the LF and HF groups across time was derived from carbohydrate. \nIn addition, VO2 was greater (p = .0004) in the LF than HF group, and the latter \nwas greater (p = .0013) in the 18 degrees C group versus the 26 degrees C group \nand increased across time (p = .0001); that is, VO2 after 5 min of immersion was \nless than at 60 and 90 min, and values obtained after 30 min of immersion were \nless than those at 90 min of immersion. Based on these data, it appears that the \nLF group would expend more calories (308.9 vs. 199.9 kcal, respectively) and \nmore likely derive these calories from a carbohydrate source than the HF group \nduring 90 min of cold water immersion. It would appear beneficial to consider a \nfeeding supplement for the low-fat individual if immersion was in a more thermal \nstressful environment or extended for a protracted period of time.\n\nDOI: 10.1580\/1080-6032(1995)006[0295:iocwio]2.3.co;2\nPMID: 11990094 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

A frequently employed strategy is \nto induce sleep before an operation, especially operations requiring prolonged \ntravel. Sleep-inducing drugs could have an action on thermoregulation through \ntheir effect on alertness and a possible direct effect on the brain. The goal of \nthis study was therefore to evaluate the effect of a commonly prescribed \ntriazolam (Halcion) on thermoregulatory responses to cold-water immersion. Eight \nsubjects were immersed twice in 18 degrees C water for up to 90 min in the \nmorning; once after ingesting 0.25 mg triazolam (TRZ) the prior evening, and \nagain after placebo (PLB) treatment. There were no significant differences \nbetween trials for mean duration of the immersion, the change in rectal \ntemperature and mean skin temperature. Total metabolic heat production was \nsimilar for both conditions: 767 +\/- 107 vs. 781 +\/- 105 kj.m-2 for TRZ and PLB, \nrespectively. The results should be considered in light of a large variation \namong the subjects in sensitivity to TRZ, which was unrelated to biometrical \ncharacteristics such as surface area-to-mass ratio, lean body mass, % body fat, \nand physical fitness. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend \nfor a smaller increase in plasma free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations \nafter water immersion with TRZ. The results suggest that the ingestion of a \nsingle dose of triazolam 11 h prior to a cold-water immersion is not likely to \naccelerate the rate of onset of hypothermia. Individual sensitivity, however, \nmay predispose some sensitive subjects to negative effects in this regard.\n\nPMID: 7575314 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Eight male subjects were rendered hypothermic \nby immersion in 15 degrees C water for 1 h.

Three \ntechniques for rewarming subjects with lowered deep body temperatures were \ncompared: a) whole body immersion to the neck in water at 40 degrees C; b) \nimmersion of two hands plus forearms only in water at 42 degrees C; and c) \npassive rewarming. The suggestion that the fall in deep body temperature \nresulting from immersion to the neck in water at 15 degrees C could be arrested \nby immersing both arms in water at 42 degrees C was also investigated. Results \nindicated that immersion to the neck in hot water was clearly the most effective \nrewarming technique. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed in the \ndeep body temperature response during passive rewarming or during immersion of \nboth hands and forearms in water at 42 degrees C. In the later condition some \nincrease in peripheral blood flow to the hands may have occurred and resulted in \na heat input of approximately 12 W, but any benefit from this was negated by an \nassociated significant decrease (p > 0.05) in intrinsic heat production. \nImmersing the arms in hot water during immersion to the neck in cold water \nappeared to accelerate rather than decelerate the rate of fall of deep body \ntemperature.

It was hypothesized that training in hot water would \nhave greater effects on muscle glycogen use and blood lactate accumulation \nduring exercise than training in cold water. Eighteen men exercised at 60% of \nmaximal oxygen uptake while immersed in hot (n = 9) or cold water (n = 9) for 1 \nh, 5 days\/wk, for 8 wk. Training in hot water (35 degrees C) potentiated body \ntemperature increases during exercise, and training in cold water (20 degrees C) \nblunted body temperature increases during exercise. Before and after training, \ncardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory responses and muscle glycogen and blood \nlactate changes were assessed during a 1-h exercise trial in hot water and, on a \nseparate day using the same intensity, in cold water. Oxygen uptake was similar \nfor all trials, averaging 2.0 +\/- 0.1 l\/min. It was observed that 1) training \nreduced glycogen use and lactate accumulation during exercise, with no \ndifference between cold and hot water training groups in the magnitude of this \neffect; 2) lactate accumulation during exercise was the same in hot water as in \ncold water; and 3) skin temperature decreased more rapidly during cold-water \nexercise after than before training, with no difference between cold and hot \nwater training groups in the magnitude of this effect. Thus, exercise-induced \nbody temperature increases are not an important stimulus for glycogen-sparing \neffects and blunted lactate accumulation associated with endurance training.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/jappl.1995.78.3.793\nPMID: 7775320 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Mondino Foundation, University of Pavia, Italy.\n\nCerebral vascular changes seem to play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of \nvarious functional disturbances, (i.e. those suggested for migraine \npathogenesis). However the exact role of single regulatory aspects \n(metabolic-neuronal-mechanic) are not completely understood and easily \ninvestigated in man. In particular, the role of autonomic nervous system is \nwidely debated and recently the stimulation of tegmental noradrenergic nuclei \n(locus coeruleus in particular) has proved capable of inducing, in the animal, \nboth the reduction and the increase of extracerebral blood flow. In order to \nevaluate the vascular effect of locus coeruleus stimulation in man, we \ninvestigated intracerebral vascular changes induced by the cold pressor test \n(CPT) (a well standardized method for activating both nociceptive and \nsympathetic pathways) by means of transcranial Doppler sonography. The \nexaminations were performed in 14 healthy controls. CPT induced a constant and \nevident reduction in mean arterial velocity of the middle cerebral artery. The \nresponse was triggered during the first minute following hand immersion in ice \nwater and reached its maximum level by the 3rd minute. Pretreatment with the \nalfa2-agonist clonidine caused a marked reduction of the cerebrovascular \nresponse. These data suggest that: a) intracerebral vascular response induced by \nCPT may be attributed to a central noradrenergic mechanism (possibly modulated \nat the locus coeruleus level) and b) transcranial Doppler monitoring of CPT \neffect is a potential tool for investigating peculiar patterns of functional \ndisturbances of cerebral circulation.\n\nDOI: 10.1080\/01616412.1994.11740219\nPMID: 7936082 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

To examine further the mechanism underlying \nthis action, we evaluated the neurocirculatory effects of oral clonidine and the \nability of clonidine to alter the hemodynamic and sympathetic responses to a \nnoxious stimulus (cold pressor test) and to baroreceptor perturbations in nine \nhealthy men (ages 20-29 yr). Heart rate (ECG), blood pressure (radial artery \ncatheter), central venous pressure (jugular vein), and cardiac output (impedance \ncardiography) were monitored before and after oral clonidine (0.3 mg) or \nplacebo. Plasma norepinephrine was measured with high-performance liquid \nchromatography. Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) to skeletal muscle blood \nvessels was recorded from a Tungsten needle positioned within the peroneal \nnerve. Baroreceptor testing was carried out by intravenous bolus injections of \nnitroprusside (100 micrograms) followed 60 s later by intravenous phenylephrine \n(150 micrograms). The slope of the linear relationship between the change in R-R \ninterval versus the change in mean pressure (cardiac baroslope) or change in SNA \nversus change in diastolic pressure (sympathetic baroslope) was determined at \nbaseline and 75 min after clonidine or placebo. In addition, peak responses to \nthe cold pressor test (60-s hand immersion in ice water) were determined at the \nsame intervals. Clonidine progressively decreased blood pressure and muscle SNA \nover the 75-min session. Clonidine subtly reduced the sympathoexcitation \nproduced by the cold pressor test but did not alter the gain of the baroreceptor \nreflex regulating cardiac interval or peripheral SNA; baroslope relationships \nwere simply shifted leftward (to operate at lower pressures).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED \nAT 250 WORDS)\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/00000542-199211000-00005\nPMID: 1443738 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Seven seminude male subjects were immersed on two occasions in 18 \ndegrees C water for 90 min or until their rectal temperature (Tre) decreased to \n35.5 degrees C. The immersion occurred after 2 h of intermittent oral ingestion \nof either nicotinic acid (NIC) or a placebo (PLAC). Plasma FFA levels \nimmediately before the immersion were significantly lower in NIC (87 +\/- 15 \nmumol\/l) than in PLAC (655 +\/- 116 mumol\/l, P less than 0.05). Although FFA \nlevels increased by 73% in NIC during the immersion (P less than 0.05), they \nremained significantly lower than in PLAC (151 +\/- 19 vs. 716 +\/- 74 mumol\/l, P \nless than 0.05) throughout the immersion. Muscle glycogen concentrations in the \nvastus lateralis decreased after cold water immersion in both trials (P less \nthan 0.05), but the rate of glycogen utilization was similar, averaging 1.00 +\/- \n0.27 mmol glucose unit.kg dry muscle-1.min-1).

In order to test this \nhypothesis, 40 subjects were sequentially put in conditions of vigilance, rest, \nstress, and feeding while colonic motility was monitored. The myoelectric \nspiking activity of the left colon was recorded with a 50-cm-long silastic tube \nequipped with four bipolar ring electrodes (located 10 cm apart) introduced into \nthe left colon by flexible sigmoidoscopy.

N6A 5C2 \nCanada.\n\nThis study evaluated the efficacy of hypnosis- and relaxation-induced \nsuggestions for analgesia for reducing the strength and unpleasantness \ndimensions of pain evoked by noxious tooth pulp stimulation and by cold pressor \nstimulation. The Tellegen Absorption Questionnaire was used to assess hypnotic \nsusceptibility for 28 subjects in order to match treatment groups according to \nsex and susceptibility scores. Tooth pulp stimulation consisted of a 1 sec train \nof 1 msec pulses at a frequency of 100 Hz, applied at 20 sec intervals to the \ncentral incisor. Six stimuli, selected between subject's pain and tolerance \nthresholds, were presented 3 times each in random order. Cold pressor \nstimulation consisted of forearm immersion in a circulating water bath \nmaintained at 0-1 degrees C. Subjects made threshold determinations of pain and \ntolerance and used Visual Analogue Scales to rate the strength and the \nunpleasantness of both noxious stimuli before and after receiving either \nhypnosis- or relaxation-induced analgesia. There were no significant differences \nin pain reductions between hypnosis- and relaxation-induced interventions. \nHowever, the percent reduction in both strength and unpleasantness varied \nsignificantly as a function of the type of pain. Both hypnosis and relaxation \nsignificantly reduced the strength and the unpleasantness of tooth pulp \nstimulation, but only the unpleasantness dimension of cold pressor pain. The \npain reductions were not correlated with subjects' hypnotic susceptibility \nlevels. The results indicate that the extent and the quality of the analgesia \nproduced by these cognitive-based therapies vary not only according to subjects' \ncharacteristics and the efficacy of the intervention, but also according to the \nnature of the noxious stimuli. Tooth pulp and cold pressor stimulation represent \nqualitatively different stimuli with respect to both the type of nerves \nactivated and the mode of stimulus application. Discrete, randomly presented \nlevels of noxious electrical stimulation to the teeth activate predominantly \nsmall fibers and produce brief pain sensations that vary unpredictably in \nintensity. In contrast, continuous cold stimulation to the forearm activates a \nvariety of nociceptive and non-nociceptive fibers and produces progressive cold \nand pain sensations with a predictable increase in intensity from cold \nsensations to paresthesia and severe pain.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/0304-3959(88)90096-6\nPMID: 3288942 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",

Each patient received in a \ndouble-blind manner and random order on two consecutive days, the \ncalcium-channel blocking agent nifedipine (20 mg) and placebo. Nifedipine \nprotection against vasospasm provoked by cold water (4 degrees C) was considered \ngood or excellent in 14 of the 16 patients (p less than 0.001 versus placebo). \nIn the second study, 30 patients [12 I, 10 PSS, 5 SLE and 3 rheumatoid arthritis \n(RA)] received in a double blind manner and random order, on two consecutive \nweeks, nifedipine (20 mg 3 time daily) and placebo. The improvement with \nnifedipine (in percentage of the decrease of the number of vasospastic attacks) \nwas 90.95 in the 1 group, 78.63 SLE and RA and 64.02 in PSS (p less than 0.01). \nAn open study during 3 months has confirmed the effectiveness of nifedipine (10 \nmg 3 times daily). The improvement was 88.92 in the 1 group, 76.33 in SLE and RA \nand 59.16 in PSS, 7 out of 30 patients stopped the treatment because of side \neffects (headache, flush, nausea, oedema of the ankles). Thus nifedipine appears \nto be extremely useful in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon.\n\nPMID: 6285445 [Indexed for MEDLINE]",
